                <p>Often investors make the mistake of the "all or nothing" fallacy. I consider this 
to be the error of thinking you need to go "all in" heavy all at once, and sell out 
for profit by exiting a position.</p>
<p>My investing reality does not function this way. I find I will often buy and sell stocks 
intermittently over time, lowering or buying more and raising my exposure based on recent events, 
earnings reports and price movements.</p>
<p>Sometimes it becomes clear that a company has negative headwinds, so I might lighten up. 
Otherwise, if a trend like AI presents itself as an opportunity, I tend to lean in to that trend.</p>
<p>Today, I bought more Spotify. It's the first time since I added more shares at $403 in Nov. 2024. 
I sold 3 shares earlier this year at an average of $500 to lock in profits, but have since wanted 
to invest more in a winning stock.</p>
<p>I've now bought Spotify stock in a range of $75 to $685 per share. Up at this high level, I'm not 
adding heavily. I picked up 2 shares, 1 of which was the first in my Roth IRA. My share count is now up to 17.
I was aiming to bring Spotify to an invested capital level on par with my Meta and Google investments. 
In my view, this is a high conviction hold that has earned its spot among tech's elite companies.
However, such a high price implies risk should their impressive growth slow. I may regret adding Spotify at such a high valuation.
Or maybe I'll wish I added more, which tends to happen with this international technology stock.</p>
<p>The business looks strong, with estimated over 700 million monthly active users. Sometimes, we 
should look to add to our winners. In my opinion, Spotify has proven it is a winner. Their gamechanging 
music streaming model growth story and focus on a best in class music player product has paid off.
Assuming the executive team is able to continue its stellar performance, I believe the stock is going higher.
Just one month ago, it reached all time high of $785. I bought this stock today at $100 less than its market price only 30 days ago. 
It seems the business can support this lofty valuation and has the potential to grow even more.</p>
<p>On my Tesla investment, I've been lowering my cost basis, trimming profits by selling shares I bought at higher lots
along with the original lot of shares I bought at $17. I have "house money" riding in the stock. 
I added and reduced my position at various times. I sold 76% of my total Tesla stake over the past 
3 years, locking in a tidy amount of profits. I want to hang on to my last 100 shares for a long time.</p>
<p>Companies like Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta have become a measuring bar for me.
Do I think this can achieve better returns than the "hyperscalers"? If not, I probably won't add or 
maybe might lighten up a position. Typically, I will only do this when I need to pay taxes or raise 
cash for living expenses.</p>
<p>In fact, the only stock I've never sold a share of is Microsoft. This is very rare, but it has been 
my highest conviction play in the past 5 years. It worked out great, with some lucky timing to catch the AI trend. 
This is more exception than the norm. Typically, I will be leveling a stock position over time in line with where 
I see suitable levels of invested capital versus other stocks. </p>
