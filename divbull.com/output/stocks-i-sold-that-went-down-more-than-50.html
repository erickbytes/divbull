                <p>Occasionally, you will be holding stocks that you should sell. It is not always going to work out when you sell. I've also sold 5 stocks that went up &gt;50%. Most times, you should hold. But this only works when the business is executing its plan and reaping profits.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNUT, -51.00%</li>
</ul>
<p>I entered Krispy Kreme Donuts for a short term trade to medium term invesment. This was an ill-fated move. I instantly became a bagholder from $13, bought the dip a few times under $10. Sold some early in the trade at a loss (good move in hindsight). Finally, after 4 quarters of earnings reports, the donuts started to smell a little funky to me. Add in that the brand is not owned by its original owners, but a venture capital firm to again took them to flounder in public markets. The business isn't as hot and fresh as its donuts. They failed to turn a profit in this most recent quarter and the past 2 reports stunk it up. My losses were sizable, but thankfully I had the sense to get out before this tumbled below $3.</p>
<ul>
<li>TDC, -51.55%</li>
</ul>
<p>This company was a short-term trade of which I knew so little about the company Teradata. Purely traded on price for a small $100-$150 position, but closed at a small profit.</p>
<ul>
<li>LYFT, -64.24%</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote earlier on this blog about my wise move to exit at $35-$55. The price currently sits at $16.
In their case, it didn't pay to be #2 in the rideshare industry. More competition ramps up soon with Waymo delivering 250K rides and Tesla beginning its rollout in June.</p>
<ul>
<li>MTCH, -81.22%</li>
</ul>
<p>I entered Match Group thinking it must be a high-margin business. Tinder and OKCupid are pinnacles of single dating life. However, I had no conviction in the idea nor the interest to understand the economics of dating apps. In retrospect, it was the right move.</p>
<ul>
<li>EB, -89.01%</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventbright was a well-known startup in the ZIRP era. They pop up occasionally in ticketing for events I attend. I only owned 1 share, which a sold above $20 for a small profit. The pandemic KO'd their business and probably never recovered.</p>
<ul>
<li>BYND, -97.11%</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond Meat rode a wave that turned out to be more of a fad. Veggie meat pops up occasionally at the restaurant. There are other products in this category, but it seems the demand for this type of food was overestimated.</p>
