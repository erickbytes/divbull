                <p>Approximately 45 days into 2026, the market saw a reversion of trades that worked in recent years. Here are some themes I've observed in the early weeks of 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Sell America, Buy International</strong></p>
<p>International stocks are performing better than US stocks so far. Total international funds like VXUS are up 9-10% year to date. The S&amp;P 500 is slightly negative so far this year. International stocks have continued their trend of ouperformance established in 2025. Seeking to diversify internationally, I decided to buy EWY. It is an ETF that tracks the MSCI Korea 25/50 Index. It provides healthy exposure to Samsung, SK Hynix, Hyundai and other South Korean companies. This ETF of South Korean stocks is up 31% year to date! I wanted to diversify internationally and also liked to add significant memory chip exposure via Samsung and SK Hynix. This is also an "emerging markets" allocation because South Korea is an emerging market. I feel happy I chose to buy more international stocks in December and January. I also invested in VXUS, SCHC and SCHF ETFs, all of which are international. So far, it couldn't have been better timing. </p>
<p>On Jan. 1st, my international stock allocation was 17% of my portfolio. As of today, 28% of my stock portfolio is allocated to international. I've been buying on the way up and reaping the outperformance against US stocks. From last September to January, I sold approximately 33% of my Microsoft position and about 25% of my Nvidia shares. I did this last year to buy a house and more recently to lower my US equity/large caps exposure and secondarily lower my technology sector exposure. However, Nvidia and Microsoft are still my two largest current stock positions, in addition to the S&amp;P 500 index and Tesla. The drawdown in Microsoft, currently -18% has hurt. But it hasn't hurt as much since I took profits from the $455 to $507 range.</p>
<p>Additionally in my HSA, I divested part of my maxed out S&amp;P 500 allocation. I then reinvested it into VTPSX mutual fund, which is the mutual fund equivalent of VXUS. Now my HSA is exposed to 57% S&amp;P 500 index, 31% international FTSE Global All Cap Ex US Index which both VXUS and VTPSX funds track. My HSA forces me to hold a minimum cash balance, so 12% in cash.</p>
<p>In retrospect, my rebalancing was "selling America" and mega-caps before it became solidified as a trend. Lucky timing was caused by the principles of diversification abroad. I'm still ridiculously long mega-caps and US equities at 71% of my stock portfolio. As bullish on America as ever. Just more diversified now to the rest of the world and looking to expand my international stock exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging Markets Buzz</strong></p>
<p>Your international stocks can either be "developed" markets or "emerging" markets. So far, I've enjoyed the boom in South Korean stocks. I also have exposure to developed markets like Japan and Canadian stocks via VXUS and SCHF funds. Additionally, emerging markets funds like IEMG are up 11% year to date. This is equivalent to investing in markets like China, Brazil or Korea. Emerging markets have started 2026 with lots of momentum. Anecdotally, I have seen more people talking online about them in bullish tone.</p>
<p><strong>Choppy Action for Magnificent 7</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft, Tesla and Amazon saw the steepest drawdowns through 1.5 months of 2026. Google and Nvidia have remained steady but seem to have plateaued in recent months. The Mag 7 make up the core of the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ.
It's not surprising that these indexes are lagging. Is it just some digestion until the next leg up, or could these hyperscalers be entering a period of extended chop?</p>
<p><strong>Small Caps and Value Stocks Are Back</strong></p>
<p>The Russell 2000 index has also outperformed year to date. Small Caps are working. I bought VBR and IJS ETFs, both of which are up 9% year to date. Both are "small-cap value" ETFs where you buy a subset of value stocks in the S&amp;P 600. Similar 
to international stocks, small caps are catching a bid so far in 2026. My value stocks like Coca-Cola and FEMSA are steadily appreciating and both hit new 52 week highs. One fund that has also performed well for me is SCHC, Schwab's "small-cap international" fund. In a significant upset, small caps and value stocks have outperformed the S&amp;P this year. Will this outperformance continue?</p>
<p><strong>REITs Are Rockin'</strong></p>
<p>REITs are outperforming the index. Real estate has seen great returns since January 1st. I'm holding O, Realty Income REIT. It's up even more than my international stocks (ex Korea) surprisingly, 16% year to date. Totally unexpected to see this asset perform so well. It seems a theme is rotation to stability so far in 2026. Investors are buying stable businesses with dependable cash flows.</p>
<p><strong>Energy, Materials, Industrials and Consumer Staples</strong></p>
<p>Energy and materials have been the strongest sectors to start the year. Industrials like CAT and DE are surging year to date. Costco and Wal-Mart have appreciated steadily. It seems the stock market has swung to favor businesses with inelastic demand like staples and energy. Industrials are a 2nd or 3rd order winner of the AI boom. Recently these sectors are popular places to stash some cash.</p>
<p><strong>Technology and Software Slumping</strong></p>
<p>Technology and software stocks have been the poorest performing sectors in 2026. Software specifically has been collectively in drawdown. Some stocks like Duolingo are down 60-70%. "SaaS" stocks, or software as a service stocks have been hammered.
My holdings in Cloudflare and Crowdstrike have been relatively stable.</p>
<p><strong>Crypto Carnage</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies across the board are down huge. All my crypto holdings got smacked. Altcoins like Dogecoin are down 31% year to date. Ethereum is -40% year to date. Bitcoin is -21% year to date. Crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood are feeling the pain as well. I was overweight cryptocurrencies, but thanks to the recent 20-40% pullback in all my holdings, I am no longer overallocated. 5% of my net worth is in crypto, slightly more than the typical 3% recommended allocation. My allocation was significantly higher before the most recent crypto winter. Still want a crypto exposure going forward even though it hasn't been fun holding the past 3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Through the first 45  days of this year, the market seemed flat for the US indexes. However, under the surface there has been lots of movement in both directions. If you're holding software or data center stocks, you are feeling pain. I feel like I am better diversified than ever, and it has helped to know I'm allocated to international, value and small-cap stocks while my blue chip large-cap stocks have been stagnant. </p>
