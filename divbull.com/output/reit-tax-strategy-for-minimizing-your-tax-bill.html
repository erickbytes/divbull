                <p>I am always learning in investing. Recently I've been reading into different cases of optimizing assets by keeping them in the right account. Placing different assets in the proper type of account can have a huge impact on your net worth down the road by reducing your tax bill. Certain assets are best suited for a 401(k) vs. some for Roth vs. a taxable brokerage account.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I decided I wanted to invest in a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) to diversify into real estate. By owning a REIT, you collect the income from a portfolio of rental properties. I chose to invest in Realty Income (O). I liked it yields a monthly dividend and have been reinvesting it back into my position. So far, it's been a steady place to keep a 1.4% position size in this turbulent year and I am slightly green in profits.</p>
<p>Reading online, I found that because REITs are required to pass through 90% of their income to shareholders, which gives them a different tax classification. The dividends REITs yield are "non-qualified dividends" which are part of your taxable income. This means that REITs are best suited for a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA. </p>
<p>Before I discovered this REIT tax nuance, I bought Realty Income in my taxable brokerage account. Now, I'm contemplating how I will shift my REIT holding into my Roth IRA. From what I've researched online, I would need to sell the position and re-buy in my Roth IRA.</p>
<p>For new investors, the key concept here is that certain assets are better suited for your taxable accounts. Another example of this that I realized recently is that holding bonds in a Roth IRA negates the tax advantage of the Roth. Bonds are best suited for a 401(k) In the case of REITs, they are subject to higher tax rates versus typical dividend stocks. Therefore,
if you want to invest in a REIT, you can keep more of your gains over the long run and maximize compounding by putting your REIT in a tax advantaged Roth IRA.</p>
