                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I have been thinking lately about whether or not exceptional user interface provides an effective block
against being disrupted by competetitors recently.</p>
<p>I've been buying Duolingo stock now that it's been cut in half in value within a span of 3 months.
The narrative that has seemingly driven down the price was sparked by Google's release of 
language learning courses generated with AI. Duolingo has also recently expanded its course lineup
rapidly thanks to the use of AI.</p>
<p>The question is, does this narrative have merit, or is it short term stock price noise?
Google itself was seemingly threatened by the same narrative earlier this year. Since it suffered its own
drop, it has rebounded in remarkable fashion.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is, yes, exceptional design and quality user experience does provide some effect of a moat.
Why? I started to think about using AI chatbots and what I personally like to use and why.</p>
<p>A few years ago, after Chat-GPT was released I adopted Bing Copilot as my primary AI chat service.
At the time, Google's Bard seemed to have a drop in quality. Later on, they released Gemini, which has become their 
flagship model with over 2 billion users of Gemini-powered AI overviews in its search product.</p>
<p>Before Gemini, I preferred Microsoft's AI copilot because it seemed to be the highest quality responses
outside of using Chat-GPT directly with OpenAI. However, my usage habits slowly changed over time.
Gemini was easily delivered in a convenient desktop app with a more fluid user interface.
I wasn't able to find an app of similar performance for Bing Copilot. Instead, I used the bing.com website 
for queries.</p>
<p>Google's user interface seemed to be the better of the two options, and I now rarely find myself hitting up Bing.
Google's answers were delivered quickly and effectively. Because of the ease of use in design, I think they won 
more of my search queries, even though I knew Bing has Chat-GPT under the hood.</p>
<p>Back to Duolingo. Google's new AI generated courses are visible from within the Google Translate app.
I checked out a course to assess if I think they have the potential to disrupt Duolingo. Pair this with new live audio translation
services and maybe you don't even need to learn a language anymore. But here's the thing: some of us actually do enjoy devoting a 
few minutes a day to reviewing a language lesson on Duolingo's app. Finally, after Duolingo's "dead duo" social media campaign,
the exit of multiple leaders from the social media team makes this a trifecta of FUD against the green bird. People love to kick this
stock while its down also. Sometimes, these are the exact opportunities where you can make market beating returns in a stock.</p>
<p>I do not think this is a serious disruption threat. I believe the market is overreacting in the short term.
Based on my beliefs, I've doubled my Duolingo share count.</p>
<p>I believe Duolingo has the edge that Spotify has against Apple Music and YouTube. The edge that Gemini had against 
Bing in my personal opinion. Better user experience. Duolingo's app is more fun, more artistic and has a more established network.
I believe it will be difficult for Google to disrupt Duolingo.</p>
<p>So far in 2025, both Duolingo's Q1 and Q2 earnings were smashed out of the park. The stock went up double digits after both reports.
Maybe I should have took more profits, but that's how it often goes with stocks. I think this one will do well in the long run.</p>
<p>I don't know what the price of Duolingo will do in future, but I believe the surprise appearance of multiple possible negative catalysts point to a short term paranoia gripping investors and causing them to doubt the future of this company. I might be wrong. It's happened many times when I decide to pick stocks. Google is definitely capable of disrupting other companies with AI. On the flip side, 
they might not ever get traction with their own educational software. I believe Duolingo will succeed. I see an 
exceptional user experience, 696 million daily active users, and healthy paid subscribers growth. How many users will Google's language learning courses have in 6 months? In 1 year? In 5 years? Management raised guidance, but noted that quarter 3 will 
be "reflective of long term investments" on the Q2 earnings call. That suggests things could get worse before they get better.
I have conviction to sit on my shares for a long time and see how things play out. As always, do your own due diligence. 
This is not financial advice.</p>
