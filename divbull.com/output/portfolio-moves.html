                <h3>Buys</h3>
<p>These are stocks I bought this year, 2025. Most were bought dollar cost average 
as prices fluctuated throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>ORCL</strong></p>
<p>One of my highest conviction holds outside of Microsoft. The hyperscaler no one remembers until
they need AI cloud computing capabilities delivered in a sensible and straightforward way.
Enter Oracle. Add in that they're buying nuclear reactors and signing billion dollar deals,
with a burgeoning backlog order book and you have a wealth of possible catalysts coming in the future.</p>
<p><strong>NVDA</strong></p>
<p>Another high conviction hold. Picks and shovels for the AI revolution. 
Hyperscalers pay Nvidia for AI. I beefed up my long position, picking up shares
from $95 to $125. I paid $12/share for about 60 shares, what's left from my first buy in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>RAYJ</strong></p>
<p>Japanese equities are very intriguing to me. This ETF raises my international exposure 
via Japanese growth stocks like Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Hitachi, Sanrio, Asics, Toyota,
Ryohein Keikaku, Disco Corp and many others.</p>
<p><strong>DUOL</strong></p>
<p>Duolingo seems to be growing their MAUs and Duolingo Max paid subscriptions at a good clip. 
Their app makes learning an addicting habit. The stock is highly valued, 
but I'm willing to make the bet based on the past few earnings calls.</p>
<p><strong>SOUN</strong></p>
<p>Soundhound AI's voice technology is feeding American businesses' hunger to deploy agentic AI.
Companies like Oracle, Ali Baba, Meta, Google and Microsoft are spending aggressively to win 
on the infrastructure side of AI. Soundhound is a way to play the application layer.
Customers of their voice tech include Five Guys, White Castle and Casey's General Stores.</p>
<p><strong>EL</strong></p>
<p>I'm sized small into a rebound stock. Now that I'm married I have realized the opportunity in 
the women cosmetics and beauty industry. Estee Lauder is a familiar name that is bouncing as 
of late. I rolled the dice with a $500 starter position. I'm up 20%, $108.69. Going well so far!</p>
<p><strong>HOOD</strong></p>
<p>Similar to EL, I'm following a hot hand in the market. Robinhood is one of the fastest moving "momentum stocks". 
It's gone up a lot, but I decided to play a small position here also. So far, I'm up 14%, $79. Like Estee Lauder, 
if it ever has a pullback, I'd consider adding more. Or maybe I'll add on the way up. That's the way to do it 
for some of the best stocks.</p>
<p><strong>SWPPX</strong></p>
<p>Buying the best 500 US companies via an index fund. I added more S&amp;P 500 index in April near the bottom
near peak panic in April.</p>
<h3>Sells</h3>
<p>I sold part of my positions in stocks like RBLX, COIN and NET because they went up after being down for years. 
In others like SPOT, RACE and MELI I'm trying to jump on a train that has been humming along.
In some cases, I was doing more pruning than big sells. Often, I sold off my higher cost lots in pieces 
at different times as the shares continued rising this year. The share counts represent what was sold only 
since January 2025 to now.</p>
<p><strong>RBLX</strong></p>
<p>Happy to see this stock finally lift in price after years in the dumps.
I wish I bought and held more, but feel good with my shares. I intend to 
hold on as Roblox seems to have improving fundamentals every day.</p>
<p>Sold: 33 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 27 Shares</p>
<p><strong>NET</strong></p>
<p>The edge computing layer of the internet. Cybersecurity.
I was overweight Cloudflare for a long time and am finally taking profits.
It was one hell of a ride from $180 in 2021 to the bottom in 2022 where 
I bought as low as $39. In the end, I have a multi-bagger. The price has gone 
5x those $39 shares to $199! Only Tesla, Nvidia, Spotify and Coinbase have achieved better returns for me.
Cloudflare is going to win at AI by being an internet advocate and mediary between the hyperscalers and the web.</p>
<p>Sold: 66 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 40 Shares</p>
<p><strong>CRWD</strong></p>
<p>Crowdstrike is another cybersecurity champion in today's stock market. 
They handled last July's blunder with grace. It seems all is well for the leader 
in endpoint security. Long term, the stock looks great. Its valuation demands perfection, 
but thus far they've delivered the goods. One of the strongest Cybersecurity companies
in the stock market.</p>
<p>Sold: 7 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 13 Shares</p>
<p><strong>COIN</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is here. Bitcoin can't be ignored. This company will be at the forefront of bringing
crypto to the people. The stock rebounded from its all-time low of $31, thanks to the US government's
anti-crypto policies that have since reversed in support for cryptocurrencies. I scooped shares
along the way, but this one was a super volatile ride that made it extremely frustrating at times. 
Like many of the stocks here, I could have made more. I decided to take small profits from 
unrealized gains and sell some higher cost trading share lots at their cost basis on the way up. 
Nonetheless, long conviction rewarded my portfolio with another multi-bagger.</p>
<p>Sold: 9 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 11 Shares</p>
<p><strong>SOXX</strong></p>
<p>Trimmed my semiconductors ETF investment after it rebounded huge since April, like many stocks.
This was small amount of the position. It was needed for extra money to pay taxes, like most of these sells.
Still very bullish on semiconductors and their role in the AI trend. This ETF has all the big names like Nvidia,
AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, Kla Corp, ASML and more.</p>
<p>Sold: 2 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 45 Shares</p>
<p><strong>COST</strong></p>
<p>Costco stock has been good to me since I bought my first share in 2023. I took some profits from $949-$1034 per share. 
The business is so impressive to me. I'm a fan and a shareholder. Sometimes I get to visit by knowing someone who is 
a member, what a treat. The $1.50 hotdog is a shining beacon of corporate strategy at its finest. 
The Costco team is crushing it and people love the store. I'm going to be a shareholder, maybe forever.</p>
<p>Sold: 6 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 9 Shares</p>
<p><strong>BABA</strong></p>
<p>I felt a bit overweight in this Chinese stock. So far, I'm in the green with profits on the position.
This is the Chinese hyperscaler infrastructure play. It has a better case that it is undervalued compared to 
the US hyperscalers. I'm bullish on Baba and could see it being a $200 stock someday. Staying long my ADRs and
collecting my dividends.</p>
<p>Sold: 18 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 75 Shares</p>
<p><strong>GOOG</strong></p>
<p>I chose to make a slight trim of shares I bought at $180 before their earnings report. I regretted it because 
the sentiment has flipped somewhat bullish recently. This sell is more about leveling this to even with my 
Meta and Spotify investments. YouTube ad revenue is running up. Search revenue is still growing. 
Cloud computing grew 28% year over year in the most recent quarter. Gemini has 450 million users, including me. 
All bullish indicators. Google is still winning. The trillion dollar question is what will happen to their
profit stream of search in the future, which will need to be defended against new AI competition.</p>
<p>Sold: 4 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 26 Shares</p>
<p><strong>RACE</strong></p>
<p>Ferrari makes one less car than the market demands to always ensure a full order book. I like that it's an
international, European equity. I already am heavily invested in several automakers and lightened up to raise funds.</p>
<p>Sold: 1 Share</p>
<p>Remaining: 3 Shares</p>
<p><strong>SPOT</strong></p>
<p>I decided to lock in some long term profits around $500. I sold 5 shares around $485 at the cost 
I bought them at in an attempt to trade short term. Should have held them all! I ended up buying back 2 shares recently.
Hyper bullish on this stock.</p>
<p>Sold: 10 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 17 Shares</p>
<p><strong>MELI</strong></p>
<p>This payments company runs like water through South America. I was overweight at the beginning of the year, so I used
it as a source of funds for living expenses. I'm wishing I kept more MercadoLibre shares, but have conviction to keep what I have
and add on any big dips.</p>
<p>Sold: 5 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 2 Shares</p>
<p><strong>O</strong></p>
<p>Realty Income is a REIT that won't blow you away with growth. The monthly dividend income is a fun twist on investing.
I lightened up on my taxable brokerage position, thinking I may buy more someday in my Roth IRA, where the dividends will
enjoy tax advantages.</p>
<p>Sold: 27 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 75 shares</p>
<p><strong>TM</strong></p>
<p>Have been holding Toyota ADRs for years. I trimmed my higher cost lots,
but will remain long. Since 2020, Toyota has sold more than 52 million cars at an average price of $32,000.
The quarterly dividend is a nice bonus also.</p>
<p>Sold: 10 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 20 Shares</p>
<p><strong>TSLA</strong></p>
<p>I caught the wave of Tesla finding profitability from 2019 to 2021. I'm trimming my exposure by taking profits
after a wild ride the past 6 years. I'm keeping the rest as a long term hold. I will be monitoring 
the robotaxi expansion and optimus progress dilligently. Hopefully auto sales will pick back up to help
support its unconventional valuation. Tesla isn't just a car company. It will be so much more according to Elon.
Never bet against Elon.</p>
<p>Sold: 99 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 106 Shares</p>

<p>Past performance is not indicative of future returns. These stocks and my convictions are not financial advice.
