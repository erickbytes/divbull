                <h3>Buys</h3>
<p>These are stocks I bought this year, 2025. Most were bought dollar cost average 
as prices fluctuated throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>ORCL</strong></p>
<p>One of my highest conviction holds outside of Microsoft. The hypserscaler no one remembers until
they need AI cloud computing capabilities delivered in a sensible and straightforward way.
Enter Oracle. Add in that they're buying nuclear reactors and signing billion dollar deals,
with a burgeoning backlog order book and you have a wealth of possible catalysts coming in the future.</p>
<p><strong>NVDA</strong></p>
<p>Another high conviction hold. Picks and shovels for the AI revolution. 
Hyperscalers pay Nvidia for AI. I beefed up my long position, picking up shares
from $95 to $125. I paid $12/share for about 60 shares, what's left from my first buy in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>RAYJ</strong></p>
<p>Japanese equities are very intriguing to me. This ETF raises my international exposure 
via Japanese growth stocks like Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Hitachi, Sanrio, Asics, Toyota,
Ryohein Keikaku, Disco Corp and many others.</p>
<p><strong>DUOL</strong></p>
<p>Duolingo seems to be growing their MAUs and Duolingo Max paid subscriptions at a good clip. 
Their app makes learning an addicting habit. The stock is highly valued, 
but I'm willing to make the bet based on the past few earnings calls.</p>
<p><strong>SOUN</strong></p>
<p>Soundhound AI's voice technology is feeding American businesses' hunger to deploy agentic AI.
Companies like Oracle, Ali Baba, Meta, Google and Microsoft are spending aggressively to win 
on the infrastructure side of AI. Soundhound is a way to play the application layer.
Customers of their voice tech include Five Guys, White Castle and Casey's General Stores.</p>
<p><strong>EL</strong></p>
<p>I'm sized small into a rebound stock. Now that I'm married I have realized the opportunity in 
the women's cosmetics andbeauty industry. Estee Lauder is a familiar name that is bouncing as 
of late. I rolled the dice with a $500 starter position. I'm up 20%, $108.69. Going well so far!</p>
<p><strong>HOOD</strong></p>
<p>Similar to EL, I'm following a hot hand in the market. Robinhood is one of the fastest moving "momentum stocks". 
It's gone up a lot, but I decided to play a small position here also. So far, I'm up 14%, $79. Like Estee Lauder, 
if it ever has a pullback, I'd consider adding more. Or maybe I'll add on the way up. That's the way to do it 
for some of the best stocks.</p>
<p><strong>SWPPX</strong></p>
<p>Buying the best 500 US companies via an index fund. I added more S&amp;P 500 index in April near the bottom
near peak panic in April.</p>
<h3>Sells</h3>
<p>I sold part of my positions in these stocks because they went up after being down for years. 
In some cases, I sold off my higher cost lots in pieces at different times as the shares 
continued rising this year. The share counts represent what was sold only since January 2025 to now.</p>
<p><strong>RBLX</strong></p>
<p>Happy to see this stock finally lift in price after years in the dumps.
I wish I bought and held more, but feel good with my shares. I intend to 
hold on as Roblox seems to have improving fundamentals every day.</p>
<p>Sold: 33 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 27 Shares</p>
<p><strong>NET</strong></p>
<p>The edge computing layer of the internet. Cybersecurity.
I was overweight Cloudflare for a long time and am finally taking profits.
It was one hell of a ride from $180 in 2021 to the bottom in 2022 where 
I bought as low as $39.In the end, I have a multi-bagger. The price has gone 
4x those $39 to $199! Cloudflare is going to win at AI by being an internet 
advocate and mediary between the hyperscalers and the web.</p>
<p>Sold: 66 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 40 Shares</p>
<p><strong>COIN</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is here. Bitcoin can't be ignored. This company will be at the forefront of bringing
crypto to the people. The stock rebounded from its all-time low of $31, thanks to the US government's
anti-crypto policies that have since reversed in support for cryptocurrencies. I scooped shares
along the way, but this one was a super volatile ride that made it extremely frustrating at times. 
Like many of the stocks here, I could have made more. I decided to take small profits from 
unrealized gains and sell some higher cost trading share lots at their cost basis on the way up. 
Nonetheless, long conviction rewarded my portfolio with another multi-bagger.</p>
<p>Sold: 9 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 11 Shares</p>
<p><strong>SOXX</strong></p>
<p>Trimmed my semiconductors ETF investment after it rebounded huge since April, like many stocks.
This was small amount of the position. It was needed for extra money to pay taxes, like most of these sells.
Still very bullish on semiconductors and their role in the AI trend.</p>
<p>Sold: 2 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 45 Shares</p>
<p><strong>COST</strong></p>
<p>Costco stock has been good to me since I bought my first share in 2023. I took some profits from $949-$1034 per share. 
The business is so impressive to me. I'm a fan and a shareholder. Sometimes I get to visit by knowing someone who is 
a member, what a treat. The $1.50 hotdog is a shining beacon of corporate strategy at its finest. 
The Costco team is crushing it and people love the store. I'm going to be a shareholder, maybe forever.</p>
<p>Sold: 6 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 9 Shares</p>
<p><strong>BABA</strong></p>
<p>I felt a bit overweight in this Chinese stock. So far, I'm in the green with profits on the position.
This is the Chinese hyperscaler infrastructure play. It has a better case that it is undervalued compared to 
the US hyperscalers. I'm bullish on Baba and could see it being a $200 stock someday. Staying long my ADRs and
collecting my dividends.</p>
<p>Sold: 18 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 75 Shares</p>
<p><strong>GOOG</strong></p>
<p>I shose to make a slight trim of shares I bout at $180 before their earnings report. I regretted it because 
the sentiment has flipped somewhat bullish recently. This sell is more about leveling this to even with my 
Meta and Spotify investments. YouTube ad revenue is running up. Search revenue is still growing. 
Gemini has 450 million users, including me. Google is still winning. </p>
<p>Sold: 4 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 26 Shares</p>
<p><strong>RACE</strong></p>
<p>Ferrari makes one less car than the market demands to always ensure a full order book. I like that it's 
international, European equity. I already am heavily invested in several automakers and lightened up to raise funds.</p>
<p>Sold: 1 Share</p>
<p>Remaining: 4 Shares</p>
<p><strong>SPOT</strong></p>
<p>I decided to lock in some long term profits around $500. I sold 5 shares around %485 at the cost 
I bought them at in an attempt to trade short term. Should have held! I ended up buying back 2 shares recently.
Hyper bullish on this stock.</p>
<p>Sold: 10 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 17 Shares</p>
<p><strong>MELI</strong></p>
<p>This payments company runs like water through South America. I was overweight at the beginning of the year, so I used
it as a source of funds for living expenses. I'm wishing I kept more, but have conviction to keep what I have.</p>
<p>Sold: 5 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining 2 Shares</p>
<p><strong>O</strong></p>
<p>Realty Income is a REIT that won't blow you away with growth. The dividend income is a fun twist on investing.
I lightened up on my taxable brokerage position, thinking I may buy more someday in my Roth IRA.</p>
<p>Sold: 27 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 75 shares</p>
<p><strong>TM</strong></p>
<p>Have been holding Toyota ADRs for years. I trimmed my higher cost lots,
but will remain long. Since 2020, Toyota has sold more than 52 million cars at an average price of $32,000.
The quarterly dividend is a nice bonus also.</p>
<p>Sold: 10 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 20 Shares</p>
<p><strong>TSLA</strong></p>
<p>I caught the wave of Tesla finding profitability from 2019 to 2021. I'm trimming my exposure by taking profits
after a wild ride the past 6 years. I'm keeping the rest as a long term hold. I will be monitoring 
the robotaxi expansion and optimus progress dilligently. Hopefully auto sales will pick back up to help
support its unconventional valuation. Tesla isn't just a car company. It will be so much more according to Elon.
Never bet against Elon.</p>
<p>Sold: 99 Shares</p>
<p>Remaining: 106 Shares</p>

<p>Past performance is not indicative of future returns. These stocks and my convictions are not financial advice.
Research, learn and invest at your own risk and good luck.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Often investors make the mistake of the "all or nothing" fallacy. I consider this 
to be the error of thinking you need to go "all in" heavy all at once, and sell out 
for profit by exiting a position.</p>
<p>My investing reality does not function this way. I find I will often buy and sell stocks 
intermittently over time, lowering or buying more and raising my exposure based on recent events, 
earnings reports and price movements.</p>
<p>Sometimes it becomes clear that a company has negative headwinds, so I might lighten up. 
Otherwise, if a trend like AI presents itself as an opportunity, I tend to lean in to that trend.</p>
<p>Today, I bought more Spotify. It's the first time since I added more shares at $403 in Nov. 2024. 
I sold 3 shares earlier this year at an average of $500 to lock in profits, but have since wanted 
to invest more in a winning stock.</p>
<p>I've now bought Spotify stock in a range of $75 to $685 per share. Up at this high level, I'm not 
adding heavily. I picked up 2 shares, 1 of which was the first in my Roth IRA. My share count is now up to 17.
I was aiming to bring Spotify to an invested capital level on par with my Meta and Google investments. 
In my view, this is a high conviction hold that has earned its spot among tech's elite companies.
However, such a high price implies risk should their impressive growth slow. I may regret adding Spotify at such a high valuation.
Or maybe I'll wish I added more, which tends to happen with this international technology stock.</p>
<p>The business looks strong, with estimated over 700 million monthly active users. Sometimes, we 
should look to add to our winners. In my opinion, Spotify has proven it is a winner. Their gamechanging 
music streaming model growth story and focus on a best in class music player product has paid off.
Assuming the executive team is able to continue its stellar performance, I believe the stock is going higher.
Just one month ago, it reached all time high of $785. I bought this stock today at $100 less than its market price only 30 days ago. 
It seems the business can support this lofty valuation and has the potential to grow even more.</p>
<p>On my Tesla investment, I've been lowering my cost basis, trimming profits by selling shares I bought at higher lots
along with the original lot of shares I bought at $17. I have "house money" riding in the stock. 
I added and reduced my position at various times. I sold 76% of my total Tesla stake over the past 
3 years, locking in a tidy amount of profits.I want to hang on to my last 100 shares for a long time.</p>
<p>Companies like Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta have become a measuring bar for me.
Do I think this can achieve better returns than the "hyperscalers"? If not, I probably won't add or 
maybe might lighten up a position. Typically, I will only do this when I need to pay taxes or raise 
cash for living expenses.</p>
<p>In fact, the only stock I've never sold a share of is Microsoft. This is very rare, but it has been 
my highest conviction play in the past 5 years. It worked out great, with some lucky timing to catch the AI trend. 
This is more exception than the norm. Typically, I will be leveling a stock position over time in line with where 
I see suitable levels of invested capital versus other stocks. </p>

                    <a href="https://divbull.com/the-etf-bias.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;The ETF Bias&quot;">The ETF Bias</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>There are tons of financial professionals and retail investors out there who drink the ETF kool-aid.
Most parrot the same general rhetoric: "don't touch individual stocks, you'll get burned".
Everyone knows that ETFs and mutual funds are a safe bet. Don't mess with individual stocks,
DCA into index funds. We've all had this hammered into our heads countless times when we consider investing.</p>
<p>The ETF bias tries to convince you that individual stocks are too risky. A 3 fund approach 
is a common strategy. Ultimately, you want to hold a mix of large/small caps and domestic/international stocks. 
If you are approaching retirement increase how much is in bonds, money market funds or treasury bills.
This target allocation can be achieved with both passive funds and individual stocks.</p>
<p>I propose that the financial industry has a bias against individual stock picking, perhaps 
because it is difficult to succeed. However, financial pros and bogleheads often write off stockpicking 
as being like going to the casino.</p>
<p>The truth is that it's easy to lose money by picking a bad stock at the wrong time. I've picked 
plenty of losers. But if you choose well, you can ride a stock's momentum for a long time, beat 
the market and make gains multiples higher than a passive approach. With stockpicking, you 
might need to be more dilligent in taking profits to reduce your downside risk. This active nature 
is not desirable to fund oriented investors. For those who don't mind the time to be hands on, 
this gives more granular control of your risk exposure.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, you should own the market. My 5th largest position currently is an S&amp;P 500 
index fund. I'm not suggesting we should abandon ETFs and mutual funds. Instead, keep your eyes 
open to stocks that are set for a 15-20 year run of an ongoing growth trend. Investing is not 
"all or nothing". You can take some small shots at a company that has the potential to give multi-bagger 
returns. Don't let the ETF bias convince you to buy the market and stay 100% passive. Find a Netflix 
before it disrupted the media game. Find an Apple when it drops a smartphone
that changed the cell phone market forever. Get into Nintendo before its Switch 2 becomes the greatest
selling console of all time. These types of moves plus some lucky timing can win.</p>
<p>I'm currently long at least 5 stocks that beat the market over the past 5 years. My bets on Cloudflare, 
Nvidia, Microsoft, Spotify and Tesla all beat the market in that time span. If I listened to 
the "play it safe" crowd, I would have missed out on these multi-bagger gains. Sure, Microsoft and Nvidia 
are two of the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 so I'm still somewhat correlated there with the S&amp;P 500. 
I'm happy to have higher exposure to these incredible companies in the early innings of the AI trend.</p>
<p>Of course, for some investors they view researching companies and trying to assess their quality as 
unnecessary burden. I view it as an activity that I enjoy that makes me money when I excel. While 
I appreciate the "set it and forget it" nature of index funds and ETFs, I find the challenge of 
stockpicking to be like an enjoyable hobby. Personal finance truly is personal. You should discover 
where your risk tolerance falls on the spectrum. I might have survivor bias from some lucky picks, 
but I stand on my ETF thesis. Don't let the ETF bias convince you it's impossible to pick stocks and win. </p>

                    <a href="https://divbull.com/earning-interest-on-your-bitcoin-with-bonded-staking.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Earning Interest on Your Bitcoin With Bonded Staking&quot;">Earning Interest on Your Bitcoin With Bonded Staking</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p><strong>Kraken Introduces Bonded Bitcoin Staking</strong></p>
<p>I recently achieved a new passive income stream by tapping into my long Bitcoin holdings.
Thanks to Kraken's new <a href="https://support.kraken.com/articles/overview-of-bitcoin-staking-on-kraken">bonded Bitcoin staking</a>
I'm now earning 0.25%-1% APR in interest against my Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Previously, Bitcoin required "bridging" to other assets or other more complex maneuvers in order to earn 
staking rewards. For comparison, Ethereum and Solana have native staking. Bitcoin is now able to earn 
staking rewards without needing to leave its native blockchain. The rewards are earned in exchange 
for securing the network by locking up your assets for up to 7 days before you can unstake.</p>
<p>This is a significant win for me. It's a new income stream that Kraken has enabled that I previously didn't have. 
I estimate my Bitcoin holdings would yield approximately $175 per year if I could achieve a 1% yield. 
The exciting part is the compounding this could enable by reinvesting the earnings back into Bitcoin 
or other assets. Potentially, my payouts will grow over time as my bitcoin holdings increase. I'm 35 years old, 
so this means I might invest an extra ~$5,000 of earnings into Bitcoin by the time I'm 70. This estimate assumes 
I live that long, stay invested, earn close to 1% and continue to reinvest the staking rewards.</p>
<p>No matter what Bitcoin's price does, I'll continue to earn rewards. I don't plan to sell any Bitcoin anytime soon.
So the 7 day lockup associated with unbonding does not worry me at all. Someday, I might reduce holdings to diversify 
and reallocate elsewhere, but I believe I'll hold Bitcoin for the rest of my life. I might as well earn yield against this asset.</p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>Kraken has teamed up with the Babylon protocol to allow Bitcoin holders to collect staking rewards against your sats.
It took my Bitcoin about 45 minutes to transfer into Kraken. Once on the exchange, it's very easy to "allocate" 
your Bitcoin to bonded staking. It only takes a few minutes to do. Go to the "Earn" page and click a button 
to allocate to bonded staking. Once you've done this, you'll receive a weekly payout in BABY tokens. </p>
<p>My first payout was $0.21, about 4.9 BABY coins. One quirk of holding the BABY tokens is that you need to 
accumulate about 25 tokens before you can convert the tokens back into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Kraken does take a commission on your earnings, which tends to be about 16-20% for smaller stakes. You can read
more details about the fees <a href="https://support.kraken.com/articles/360037682011-overview-of-staking-on-kraken">here</a>.</p>
<p>This is an awesome opportunity that Kraken has enabled for extra passive income against the king of crypto assets.
If you're holding Bitcoin, do some research into yield opportunities for your holdings. It can potentially 
become a new income stream.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>In its 2024 Q2 and Q3 earnings reports, Enphase Energy had an optimistic tone on their earnings call.
The solar system installer looked ahead to 2025, expecting interest rate cuts to come from the Fed. 
The confidence of their executive team suggested they would thrive in the coming environment. 
This turned out to be a solar flare. It was the light at the end of the tunnel that dissipated, 
failing to come to fruition. Why? Will solar stocks finally rip to the moon when the proverbial rate cuts arrive?</p>
<p>No one predicted that Trump would unleash his tariff driven policy in 2025, 
which raised the cost of materials to build their solar rigs. The other thing 
that we didn't see coming was the repeal of solar credits by the United States government.
Additionally, no one predicted that President Trump would demand rate cuts and even 
threaten to fire Chairman Powell from the Fed. This has seemingly had a reverse effect 
of what Trump wanted, as now the Fed has become paralyzed to an extent 
while they survey the chaos that Trump has reaped in his first 6 months as president.</p>
<p>These 3 conditions, a lack of rate cuts, tariffs to increase business costs and removal 
of solar government subsidies in Trump's "big beautiful bill", created a solar storm for 
companies competing in this energy space. The long term view is that solar will be a necessary 
piece to feed our society's energy needs. However, the narrative has detached from the business 
reality. The removal of government credits will put these solar companies to the test.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I sold out of my Enphase Energy shares at $48, taking a substantial loss. 
I had been buying the dip since $140. In May 2024, I sold out of my Sunrun shares at $12, 
taking a slightly smaller but still significant loss. I sold out of both because I believed 
that they could go lower based on shaky business fundamentals. Recently, that has been the case.
This morning, Enphase Energy shares are priced at $33, down -23%. Sunrun shares are priced at $5.73,
down -40% this morning on the solar credit termination news. Bankruptcy appears to be a real possibility.</p>
<p>In theory, solar was a great investment idea. In practice, it was not for me. Perhaps 
I could chalk it up to poor timing, mediocre stock picking and unlucky policy. After owning for 
approximately 2 years, I harvested the losses to lower my tax bill. In retrospect, this prevented 
another $1,062 of capital loss had I held on. My total realized loss from solar investments is $3,369.</p>
<p>Today, I'm only holding a small position in First Solar (FSLR) to invest in the solar industry. 
In my opinion, this company is the most likely to succeed of the 3 companies I had invested in, 
so I kept my shares. I hope to stay invested for a long time. It's currently down -16% on the 
solar credit news, not as bad as the ENPH and RUN. It seems to have the strongest fundamentals 
after following these 3 companies since 2021.</p>
<p>A critical nuance of investing in Solar is to distinguish whether the business competes in 
commercial or residential solar. Enphase and Sunrun are more exposed to the residential solar customer. 
The subsidy revisions in the recent tax bill imply a larger hit to the companies in the residential sector. 
The moves in ENPH and RUN confirmed by dropping more than others who compete in commercial solar, like 
First Solar. It's easy to want to "invest in solar" without considering that residential home installation 
solar companies might be less efficient than large scale commercial operations. This wasn't obvious 
to me when I started buying solar stocks. It's a nugget of wisdom gleaned from my solar follies.</p>
<p>While I can be right about a general trend like solar, it is less likely that I'll  pick the 
"winners" that make it long term in this industry. Therefore, I've reduced my solar exposure 
for now. If I feel the industry sentiment improving, I'll buy more of a solar energy 
ETF like the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN). </p>
<p>While the long term solar narrative is unaffected, the businesses competing in this space are 
undergoing growing pains. The subsidies they've grown dependent on are being taken away. 
Will they survive? Some will, and some will not. That's the reality of business.
There is always risk in investing. Threats can come from government action. In this case, 
a policy reversal spelled doom for solar stocks. Some of them will likely recover in the long term, 
but that is not much consolation for investors. Maybe I got what I deserved, investing in an industry 
more reliant on the government, when that government is cutting clean energy subsidies and raising interest rates,
while other energy sources like nuclear remain uncut.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Tesla is unique company. They make electric vehicles, robotics and also have a thriving energy storage business.</p>
<p>Fundamentals-based investors get squeamish when they dig into Tesla's financials. The valuation of Tesla often 
struggles to hold up against its actual fundamentals. Because of this, a 50% drawdown is not uncommon for the stock. </p>
<p>My theory of Tesla stock is that you can't look at it this way. It is a "story stock", with levers in AI, autonomous driving robotaxis and the transition to renewable energy backing it. Tesla trades on vibes and stories.</p>
<p>They are a profitable at a time when the electric vehicle (EV) movement is pumping the brakes. Long term, I believe Tesla will be competitive in EVs, but it is getting tougher for them with more competitors entering the market.</p>
<p>Tesla had the "first mover" advantage in EVs and parlayed it into a profitable business with many potential new levers of growth. Nowadays, it is a more risky bet given how its valuation has swollen since 2019. I have sold down the position to below a 10% allocation in my portfolio to hedge my downside risk if robotaxis don't pan out. I wouldn't recommend the stock in 2025, given what I've known from being an investor for 6 years. But could there be more money to be made on the stock? Ultimately, that's what investors want.</p>
<p>My point is that Tesla is its own animal. Someday, it will likely be thriving in robotics and autonomous driving. When you consider Tesla as an investor, you need to consider the vibes and the story. Admittedly, it is risky to invest this way. That's why more disciplined investors have scoffed at its prospects as an investment ever since I first bought the stock 6 years ago.</p>
<p>With Tesla, you need to look at the company wholistically. Watch where it's heading in the long run. Stay invested for the long run. This has been the pattern historically that has paid faithful investors, but past returns are no indication of future results. You need to read the vibes and put the fundamentals on the back shelf if you are researching Tesla. </p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I am always learning in investing. Recently I've been reading into different cases of optimizing assets by keeping them in the right account. Placing different assets in the proper type of account can have a huge impact on your net worth down the road by reducing your tax bill. Certain assets are best suited for a 401(k), some for a tax advantaged Roth IRA and the rest into a taxable brokerage account.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I decided I wanted to invest in a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) to diversify my portfolio into real estate. By owning a REIT, you collect the income from a portfolio of rental properties. </p>
<p>I chose to invest in <a href="https://www.realtyincome.com/">Realty Income (O)</a>. It yields a monthly dividend, which I've reinvested back into my position. So far, it's been a steady place to keep a 1.4% position size in this turbulent year. As of today, I'm slightly in the green in profits. In their Q1 earnings report on May 5th, Realty Income mentioned it is the 7th largest REIT globally. They also pointed out that they have 98.5% portfolio occupancy, so nearly 99% of their properties are being actively rented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We owned or held interests in 15,627 properties, which were leased to 1,598 clients doing business in 91 industries."
- Q1 2025 Realty Income Earnings Call</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading online, I found that REITs are required to pass through 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. This gives them a different tax classification. The dividends REITs yield are "non-qualified dividends" which are part of your taxable income. This means that REITs are best suited for a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA to keep more of your dividends.</p>
<p>Before I discovered this REIT tax nuance, I bought Realty Income in my taxable brokerage account. Now, I'm contemplating how I will shift my REIT holding into my Roth IRA. From what I've researched online, I would need to sell the position and re-buy in my Roth IRA. It is ok to keep a REIT in your taxable brokerage if you want to yield money you can use immediately.
However, the tax hit on your dividends will be substantial in a taxable brokerage account. You'll also pay a higher tax on the dividends if you earn more from your salary or business, depending which tax bracket you fall into.</p>
<p>For new investors, the key concept here is that certain assets are better suited for your tax advantaged accounts. Another example of this that I realized recently is that holding bonds in a Roth IRA negates the tax advantage of the Roth. Bonds are best suited for a 401(k). </p>
<p>In the case of REITs, they are subject to higher tax rates versus typical dividend stocks. Therefore, if you want to invest in a REIT, you can keep more of your gains over the long run and maximize compounding by putting your REIT in a tax advantaged Roth IRA.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>After the post-market session closes for the night, I tend to check in on the market at night in a few different places. Foreign markets, overnight markets and futures offer a look at what the market might do next. Here are my go-to spots to check the market's pulse after dark.</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing.com Futures</li>
</ul>
<p>Checking <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures">Investing.com futures</a> is a good signal for coming market reaction to news headlines. It's not a sure-fire indicator of how tomorrow will trade, but it usually gives a good hint at how the market will open up when news breaks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Robinhood Overnight Market</li>
</ul>
<p>Most stocks now trade on an "overnight" market, which can be seen when checking Robinhood after 8 PM American Central Standard Time. You can check in on the more popular stocks to see how they're trending overnight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Europe and Asian Markets</li>
</ul>
<p>Germany, Japan and Chinese markets may give hints about what is coming tomorrow. If Nvidia stock trades up in Germany, it will likely do the same here. If Nintendo trades up in Japan, its American Depository Receipts (ADRs) tend to see the same price action. I am holding a Japanese growth stock ETF, <a href="https://funds.rayliant.com/rayj/">RAYJ</a>. So I often check a watchlist of stocks I hold through it most nights at 6 PM CST when the Japanese markets begin trading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin sometimes does act like a tech stock. A reaction move in Bitcoin often foreshadows what tech stocks will do. Other times, it moves inversely to stocks completely, similar to gold. Therefore Bitcoin's price reaction is often a leading indicator since it trades 24/7.</p>
<p>These indicators are not something I check every night. Occasionally, when some news breaks, I might check these places to guage what kind of reaction is coming.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I've been buying and selling stocks for about 8 years. In that time, I've mostly bought and held.
Occasionally I will prune my stock portfolio. Sometimes the stocks I sold moved further down in price. 
On 3 occasions, I've sold a stock and it went on to achieve greater than 100% return. It's painful for me to review,
but I think it's a healthy exercise to review your mistakes and try to not repeat them again.</p>
<ul>
<li>BROS, +128%</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided I didn't want to invest in the "next Starbucks". Even though the business is growing healthily, I decided 
I prefer other opportunities. People seem passionate about their Dutch Bros drinks. I misread the stock and could have doubled my money if I bought instead of selling out in 2024 at $29.50 for a measly $7 profit.</p>
<ul>
<li>PBPB, +248%</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my first stock picks was a good one in hindsight. However, my inexperience caused me to doubt the future of this sandwich shop chain. Checking back 5 years later, I was shocked to see how the stock had done. I sold the bottom at $2.89 in 2020. If I had stayed the course instead of bailing after 4 months, I would have tripled my money within 5 years. Instead I sold out at a ~$300 loss, flushing away what would have been a $1,700 gain today at the current price of $9.88.</p>
<ul>
<li>PLTR, +408%</li>
</ul>
<p>I only held one share of Palantir for 6 months in 2021. I saw the stock constantly being discussed online and threw in $23. That share is now worth $124. Their dependency on government business contracts seemed a turn-off to me. I sold. I get that now they have the AI story as well. This is a promising company for sure, but I won't be purchasing shares at such a high valuation. At least my S&amp;P 500 position gives me some exposure to Palantir's upside, so I caught the gains since they were added in September 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Nobody Gets It Right Every Time</strong></p>
<p>My read on these stocks was incorrect. I could have made money in them if I worked up more conviction. However,
sometimes I just feel a stock is not the right type of business for me. I am not interested in what Palantir is doing.
Also, there's no guarantees Dutch Bros will make it, but it seems they're executing at a high level currently.
I'm happy for these businesses to succeed. Potbelly was not an obvious winner stock to me, but now I can see with the benefit of time, it actually beat the market. It appears they're doing something right. Those are the types of unexpected winners that stock pickers dream about.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Occasionally, you will be holding stocks that you should sell. It is not always going to work out when you sell. I've also sold 5 stocks that went up &gt;50%. Most times, you should hold. But this only works when the business is executing its plan and reaping profits. In some of these trades, I got out at a profit before the stock moved down. In others, I took a loss to move on from a bad decision, and then the stock continued to lose more than half its value.</p>
<ul>
<li>DNUT, -51%</li>
</ul>
<p>I entered Krispy Kreme Donuts for a short term trade to medium term investment. This was an ill-fated move. I instantly became a bagholder from $13, bought the dip a few times under $10. After seeing my questionable pick, I sold half of my shares early in the trade at a loss at $10.45, a good move in hindsight. Still, I bought the dip when the price dipped below $9. After 3 quarters of following the earnings reports, the donuts started to smell a little funky to me. Add in that the brand is not owned by its original owners, but a venture capital firm who bought them privately to then return to flounder in public markets. The business isn't as hot and fresh as its donuts. They failed to turn a profit in this most recent quarter and the past 2 reports stunk it up. Management put a lot of its chips in the McDonalds partnership growth lever, which seems to have fizzled out. My losses were sizable, but thankfully I had the sense to get out at $6 before this tumbled below $3. In total, this little maneuver cost me $1,382. I would be in worse shape holding my Krispy Kreme bags today, given the state of the company and diving stock price.</p>
<ul>
<li>TDC, -51.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>This company was a short-term trade of which I knew so little about the company, Teradata. Traded a small $100-$150 position and closed at a small profit. Really not sure why I messed with this stock. It was a good move to kick it out of my portfolio, seeing it has lost half its value looking back to when I traded it.</p>
<ul>
<li>RUN, -53%</li>
</ul>
<p>Sunrun is a solar installer that lacked fundamentals. Their dependence on solar credits and flimsy durability in tough times made this a poor investment. I sold out at $12. Looking back, I believe it was the right call. I couldn't have known that the United States government would increase the cost of materials with tariffs and strip away solar subsidies in 2025, dealing a knockout blow to Sunrun. Today, shares trade at $5.73, at less than half their value when I sold out.</p>
<ul>
<li>UA, -58%</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Armor was one of my first stock picks. It was a terrible pick. I was only invested in the stock for 4 months. I felt the general sentiment was awful around their earnings reports. 2017 was a difficult year for the company. I sold out of my 30 shares in 2017 above $14 at a -22% loss. I couldn't justify choosing this company over Nike and didn't have much conviction due to negative operating sentiment. Suffice to say it's been a rough decade for athletic wear stocks. Looking back, with more patience I could have waited a few years to sell at breakeven or a small profit. However, checking back 8 years later, the stock is worth $6. Staying long UA from 2017 would have been a negative ROI, with more than half the investment value lost.</p>
<ul>
<li>LYFT, -64%</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote in an <a href="https://divbull.com/getting-out-of-lyft-stock">earlier post on this blog</a> about my wise move to exit at $35-$55. The price currently sits at $16. In their case, it didn't pay to be 
number 2 in the rideshare industry. More competition ramps up soon with Waymo delivering 250K rides 
and Tesla beginning its rollout in June. I closed out my Lyft position for a $600+ loss. Similar to Krispy Kreme, I took the losses to lower my taxable income. In both stocks, I would be sitting on much larger losses if I kept my shares.</p>
<ul>
<li>API, -69%</li>
</ul>
<p>In the boom times of 2021, I impulsively bought the dip on the company that made Clubhouse. I bought Agora stock during Clubhouse's 15 minutes of fame moment after the pandemic. Remember Clubhouse? It's an audio service that offered live community chat audio rooms. It was not a good stock to hold since 2021. Fortunately, I kept my losses limited to $194, so it's not as deep a flesh wound as some other stocks have made. The stock has been sliding downhill ever since I got in above $90 and added on further drops. In the end, I tax harvested the losses and sold out at an average of $7. The current price is $3.59 so this beaten down stock did have room to fall even more. It was an odd bet to make that I didn't really think through. China exposure adds more risk here also. I think the lesson from this trade is that when a stock is having a moment of ultra hype and fame, don't get caught up in the flurry too much. I believe that is what happened to me when Clubhouse was having its moment. I also, being a developer, was attracted to the ticker "API". I thought I saw something disruptive happening in the audio space. The better audio investment choice would have been to add to my Spotify position. Fortunately, I don't often treat the stock market like a casino, and when I do, I typically don't bet a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li>CGC, -76%</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to invest in the marijuana boom, and Canopy Growth was one of the best known options to play the trend 5 years ago. This trade is runner-up for my worst investment outcome. The business is run like it's management's own personal credit card account. They're nowhere near profitable, and no signs of a turnaround. I rode this stock down too far and made the mistake of adding when it tanked. In the end, it was a $1,052 mistake that cost me most of my investment after holding for 3 years. The silver lining is that I did sell at a local high exiting at $7 before it dropped another 76% to below $2. I was so sick of this company by the time I sold, I felt a huge relief to no longer be holding. Good riddance.</p>
<ul>
<li>MTCH, -81%</li>
</ul>
<p>I entered Match Group thinking it must be a high-margin business. It holds my personal record for the shortest time I've ever held an investment at 1 month and 3 days from open to close. Tinder, Hinge, Match.com and OKCupid are pinnacles of single dating life. Match Group has the market cornered it seems. However, I had no conviction in the idea nor the interest to understand the economics of dating apps. Then consider the fact that a dating app that does its job, connecting 2 people to start a relationship, causes Match to lose 2 users everytime it succeeds. In retrospect, it was the right move to move on from being a dating app investor. I sold my 3 shares at an average of $158 to cash in $5 of profits before the bottom fell out of this stock. It now trades around $29. Sometimes the best wins are the shots you don't take.</p>
<ul>
<li>EB, -89%</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventbright was a well-known startup in the ZIRP era. They pop up occasionally in ticketing for events I attend. I only owned 1 share, which I bought and sold above $20 for a tidy $0.67 profit. The pandemic was a huge setback to their business and the stock reflects that thesis today. The market price as of today hovers around $2.</p>
<ul>
<li>BYND, -97.5%</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond Meat rode a wave that turned out to be more of a fad. Veggie meat pops up occasionally at the restaurant. There are other products in this category, but it seems the demand for this type of food was overestimated. The position was small, 7 shares. Thankfully I didn't hang onto this one. I closed out the position at a $114 average for a $138 profit. I sold because it was low conviction to believe in the fake meat industry. Today it is priced under $3, so I made the right call to get out.</p>
<ul>
<li>BRDS, -100%</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not often you will sell a stock and it actually ends up going to zero. I now can now tell the story of accomplishing this rare feat and have a little chuckle about the disaster. Foolishly, I was playing a trade for a bounce in a scooter company. This is my dumbest trade/investment idea ever. I simply didn't know what I was investing in. I saw some "merger" news that sounded bullish for them to become the largest scooter company in the USA via an acquisition of the scooter startup "Spin". "Why not own the #1 scooter rideshare company?", I thought. I had seen both Bird and Spin operating in cities like Denver and St. Louis. So I threw $200 in on a whim. The "news" (stock pump piece) of them becoming the #1 biggest scooter company in America was actually a precursor to "restructuring" and bankruptcy. I ignored the warning messaged from my broker not to buy the shares and bought in, looking for a comeback story. Bad news hit days after I bought shares. The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for having too small of a market cap. The ticker moved to over the counter (OTC) exchange and the ticker was later changed from BRDS to BRDSQ. I averaged down on my shares on the OTC, hoping to break even.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="s2">&quot;We firmly believe that BRDS current market cap does not reflect the intrinsic value of the Company,&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Michael</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Washinushi</span>,<span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">Bird</span><span class="err">&#39;s interim CEO, was quoted as saying in the statement on Friday. &quot;And while disappointing, this change in our listing status on the NYSE does not alter our commitment to our shareholders, our valued employees across Bird and Spin, our partners and the many global cities and institutions with which we work.&quot;</span>
<span class="err">/- CNBC, https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/scooter-company-bird-delisted-from-nyse-will-trade-over-the-counter</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The message from the business was that they were staying the course, rebuilding with the Spin acquisition, and "committed to our shareholders". It turned out the acquisition was a facade to hide Bird's rotten core. After getting some skin in the game, I was eyeing the upcoming earnings call to learn more about what was going on with this mysterious business. Little did I know, the executives had no intention to host the call. When they made a surprise late night blog post announcement to "restructure" assets and reconcile with creditors, I set my sell order. I didn't want to be left holding the empty bag. Thankfully I had subscribed to the company website via RSS feed so I immediately saw the news. My final trade executed at open at $0.26 to sell 500 shares I had bought anticipating a recovery. After I sold it all, that day it plunged to below $0.10. I managed to get out at a -79% loss, losing $490. It was small bet that resulted in stunningly huge % short term losses in only 3 months from open to close of the trade. I deserved it for not doing my homework. </p>
<p>By selling at open the day after the bankruptcy news broke, I avoided the fall to zero and walked away with $129. Bird Global is no longer a publicly traded company, and no value was returned to shareholders due to all assets absorbed in repaying the scooter company's creditors. I still see their scooters in operation occasionally when I visit random cities. They have likely been absorbed by other scooter companies if they are still running or are still operating some places. The website still is live. If you search Bird scooters in the news, you'll see various cities are still kicking them out of town to this day. It's a constant reminder to me that good stocks will work for you and the worst stocks actually take from you.</p>
