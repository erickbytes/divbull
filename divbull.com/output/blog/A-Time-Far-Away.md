Investing requires seeing beyond the all around us. We are emotional creatures who fly off the cuff so easily. It helps to imagine a time far away from our current trials and tribulations as a species. This hypothetical time when the whole world cooperated for the greater good of commerce, prosperity and freedom for every soul on this damn planet. That is the admittedly optimistic bull case to juxtapose to the current environment. How much could the world change in 5, 10 or 20 years? War is disgusting, but I guess it's our current state of affairs.
