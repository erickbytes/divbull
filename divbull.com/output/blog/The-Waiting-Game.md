One of the hardest parts of investing is not doing anything at all. You need to wait for your investments to compound over time. The problem is the narratives that surround your investments. Unexpected "black swan" events like war and COVID can scare investors into thinking they know what's going to happen.

I am not against actively managing your portfolio. Sometimes, we need to consider new information that changes our theory for why something will be a solid investment. Sometimes, there are simply better options to re-allocate your losses into another more promising company.

However, most times the best action is not to make any moves. You've got a large unrealized loss, but how do you know that volatility won't swing the other way on your position?

Investing is tough because it's easy to be convinced by a stranger or talking head online that they know what's going to happen. More often than not, it's best to play the waiting game. Gains compound over time. Extend your holding period and the likelihood your profit increases.
