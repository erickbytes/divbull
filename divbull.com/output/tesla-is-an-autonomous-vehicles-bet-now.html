                <p>When I began investing in Tesla (TSLA) in 2019, I bought the stock because I believed in electric vehicles. They made sense to me. Someday, we'll be out of gas. We'll need electric vehicles. Stocks go up in the long run and demand for electric vehicles will grow in the future, so I made it a long term investment.</p>
<p>Tesla cornered the EV market in the 2020s and grew its sales impressively. My stock soared. Tesla was overbought in 2021, before the EV wave fizzled out with interest rates jacked up. Now growth is slowing. Electric vehicle sales are decelerating. However, the rise of the robotaxi is now what we investors are told to wait for.</p>
<p>In 2024, the company finds itself heading down a new road: autonomous vehicles. Elon himself said on the earnings calls, if you don't believe vehicles will drive themselves someday, sell the stock.</p>
<p>A bet on Tesla is a bet on electric vehicles, robotaxis and some additional moonshots. In order for the stock price to hold up, they need the Cybercab to be unveiled and they'll need to grow other revenue streams.</p>
<p>Tesla changed the world by being the first profitable pure electric vehicle maker. The million dollar question is now... can they change the world again?</p>
<p>They have a convincing product with Full Self Driving (FSD) seemingly improving every month. But what are the real timelines we'll see for autonomous vehicles? Teslas may also face opposition from other motorists on the road. If no one is driving the car, will other drivers accept Teslas driving on the road and not interfere with them? Will lawmakers allow these cars to run the streets?</p>
<p>Waymo is already active in a small grid of California and Baidu (BIDU) is assisting Tesla with mapping in China. Will the world continue to shift to AI vehicles?</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty of this line of new autonomous business, we should not count Tesla out. It's a company with many irons in the fire that could yield profits in the future. For example, 46% of Q2 net income came from Tesla's energy business, not from EVs. It also claims it's now using its Optimus robot in production.</p>
<p>Tesla's robotaxi event on October 10th will hopefully tell us more about what our vehicles will or will not do in the future. We'll see.</p>
