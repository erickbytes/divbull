&lt;p&gt;These are stocks I bought this year, 2025. Most were bought in dollar cost average 
fashion as prices fluctuated throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are stocks I bought this year, 2025. Most were bought in dollar cost average 
fashion as prices fluctuated throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MSFT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often cited as a "tech ETF" in itself due to diversifed revenue streams, key OpenAI partnership,
and incredible executive team. Github, Github Copilot, Azure cloud computing growth,
AI infrastructure play. Not to mention its gaming operations. I have committed more 
capital here than anywhere else over the past 5 years. I have other dividend stocks like Costco, Coca-Cola and Ford.
This stock is worth mentioning as a "buy" in my book because of the dividend stream. Unfortunately, I didn't buy
any more whole Microsoft shares YTD, which was a missed opportunity. However, I have bought in the past.
I always reinvested my dividends so I am always buying fractional shares. I buy Microsoft 4 times a year, 
every year thanks to reinvesting my quarterly dividend. Halfway through 2025, I've reinvested $125 of 
dividends into Microsoft stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NVDA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A top 3 high conviction hold if not #1. Picks and shovels for the AI revolution. 
Hyperscalers pay Nvidia for AI. Data center revenue on fire. I beefed up my long position, picking up shares
from $95 to $147. I paid $12/share for 50 shares in 2021. That's what I'm still holding from my 
first buy after stock splits. Good enough for a 13x return. Staying long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORCL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my highest conviction holds outside of Microsoft and Nvidia. I got in last November 
and added more shares in January. They're the hyperscaler no one remembers until they need 
AI cloud computing capabilities delivered in a sensible and straightforward way.
Enter Oracle. Add in that they're buying nuclear reactors, data centers and signing billion dollar deals,
with a burgeoning backlog order book and you have a wealth of possible catalysts coming in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NTDOY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After buying at various times since 2021, I added more Nintendo ADRs in anticipation of the runup to their 
Switch 2 release after seeing the signs of successful console launch. My intuition was rewarded,
as the ADR price is up 49% year to date. I boosted my ADR share count by ~33% in March, April 
and June after the launch. I have high confidence in Nintendo to ride the Switch 2 console and continue 
rolling out new games like Donkey Kong Bananza to galvanize the fan base. It will continue to leverage 
its intellectual property. The new Florida "Super Nintendo World" theme park opened for business in May at Universal Studios.
Plus Super Mario Bros and Zelda movie releases are coming. Nintendo seems to have many positive catalysts ahead. 
Nintendo is creating new generations of fans beyond its past consoles like the Super Nintendo, N64, Gameboy, 
Nintendo DS, Wii and the original Switch. This is an impressive company, the more you learn about it. 
I'm enjoying having this international stock in my portfolio. Includes added bonuses like a stake in 
The Pokemon Company and the Seattle Mariners baseball team, plus a semi-annual dividend. 
I have been loving the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-today-mobile/?srsltid=AfmBOor9ScrJgzMyLeOriEzFUitceiCOpHfL-K4HdLHW7O16YyVWRE45"&gt;"Nintendo Today!" app&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with happenings. 
It makes you realize the depth and breadth of their IP. It also showcases how good they are at building hype 
with events like Switch 2 previews and "Nintendo Direct". For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg&amp;amp;ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica"&gt;Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct&lt;/a&gt; seemed to make a big splash online for the game before it released.
These type of successful, high profile game releases will drive more console sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAYJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Nintendo, other Japanese equities are very intriguing to me. This ETF raises 
my international exposure via Japanese growth stocks like Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Hitachi, 
Sanrio, Asics, Toyota, Ryohein Keikaku, Disco Corp and many others. I like this as a diversification play
away from the US hyperscalers and S&amp;amp;P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDDT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit is a guilty pleasure for me. I spend way too much time there. They seem to have a mine of fodder for
AI to train on in their forums. Often I find if I use an app or product nearly every day, it 
is a signal that it might be a good investment. But then again, I could have drawn the same conclusion
about Stack Overflow 10 years ago and it would have turned out to be incorrect. In January, I bought some shares 
at $185. In April, I bought more at $87. I continued adding on the bounce since April. As it stands,
I'm holding the position at breakeven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUOL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of apps I use everyday. Duolingo seems to be growing their MAUs and Duolingo Max paid subscriptions at a good clip. Their app makes 
learning an addicting habit. The stock is highly valued, but I'm willing to make the bet based on the past 
few earnings calls. I'm on a 131 day Spanish streak. Using the product, I'm enjoying it. Their artistic execution 
makes learning more fun. Per their Q2 earnings report, Duolingo added a record number of DAUs, surpassing 10 
million paid subscribers. They are rapidly expanding their course offering with the help of AI. I bought the dip in March,
but regret that I didn't trim profits when stock sharply rose above $500 after its most recent earnings report. 
It's now hovering around $360. Maybe it's smart to keep the shares. I feel this could be a good stock long term, 
given what I have witnessed so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUBO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought more Fubo TV since the merger deal with Disney was announced. It hasn't been great adding more since 
the initial pop off the deal news in early January. I believe that this will go higher once the deal with Disney closes. 
Fubo was making moves before they struck an agreement with Disney, so I added more to a winner. 
Hoping it pays off in the future, but so far 2025 has not been great for the stock outside of the first week of the year.
I like the stock as a play on streaming and live sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOUN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soundhound AI's voice technology is feeding American businesses' hunger to deploy agentic AI.
Companies like Oracle, Alibaba, Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are spending aggressively to win 
on the infrastructure side of AI. Soundhound is a way to play the application layer.
Customers of their voice tech include Five Guys, White Castle and Casey's General Stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sized small into a rebound stock. Now that I'm married I have realized the opportunity in 
the women cosmetics and beauty industry. Estee Lauder is a familiar name that is bouncing as 
of late. I rolled the dice with a $500 starter position. I'm up 20%, $108.69. Going well so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOOD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to EL, I'm following a hot hand in the market. Robinhood is one of the fastest moving "momentum stocks". 
It's gone up a lot, but I decided to play a small position here also. So far, I'm up 14%, $79. Like Estee Lauder, 
if it ever has a pullback, I'd consider adding more. Or maybe I'll add on the way up. That's the way to do it 
for some of the best stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SWPPX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying the best 500 US companies via an index fund. I added more S&amp;amp;P 500 index in April near the bottom
near peak panic in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold part of my positions in stocks like RBLX, COIN and NET because they went up after being down for years. 
In others like SPOT, RACE and MELI I'm trying to jump on a train that has been humming along.
In some cases, I was doing more pruning than big sells. Often, I sold off my higher cost lots in pieces 
at different times as the shares continued rising this year. The share counts represent what was sold only 
since January 2025 to now. I had to decide which stocks to sell in order to pay an abnormally high tax bill this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RBLX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy to see this stock finally lift in price after years in the dumps.
I wish I bought and held more, but feel good with my shares. I intend to 
hold on as Roblox seems to have improving fundamentals every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 33 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 27 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The edge computing layer of the internet. Cybersecurity. I was overweight Cloudflare for a long time 
and am finally taking profits and trimmed my shares I bought from $125 to $200 before the drop.
It was one hell of a ride from buying in near $200 in 2021 to the bottom in 2022 where I bought 
as low as $39. In the end, I have a multi-bagger. The price has gone 5x those $39 shares to $199! Only 
Tesla, Nvidia, Spotify and Coinbase have achieved better returns for me. Cloudflare is going to win at 
AI by being an internet advocate and mediary between the hyperscalers and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 66 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 40 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRWD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowdstrike is another cybersecurity champion in today's stock market. 
They handled last July's blunder with grace. It seems all is well for the leader 
in endpoint security. Long term, the stock looks great. Its valuation demands perfection, 
but thus far they've delivered the goods. One of the strongest Cybersecurity companies
in the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 7 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 13 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cryptocurrency is here. Bitcoin can't be ignored. This company will be at the forefront of bringing
crypto to the people. The stock rebounded from its all-time low of $31, thanks to the US government's
anti-crypto policies that have since reversed in support for cryptocurrencies. I scooped shares
along the way, but this one was a super volatile ride that made it extremely frustrating at times. 
Like many of the stocks here, I could have made more. I decided to take small profits from 
unrealized gains and sell some higher cost trading share lots at their cost basis on the way up. 
Nonetheless, long conviction rewarded my portfolio with another multi-bagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 9 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 11 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOXX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimmed my semiconductors ETF investment after it rebounded huge since April, like many stocks.
This was a small amount of the position, approximately 4% of my stake. It was needed for extra money to pay taxes, 
like most of these sells. Still very bullish on semiconductors and their role in the AI trend. 
This ETF has all the big names like Nvidia, AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, Kla Corp, ASML and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 2 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 45 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CROX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Crocs product and business concept. Footwear has a huge total addressable market.
I see their product everywhere I go. I think this is a possible "value stock". Buying here is a reasonable 
valuation for a successful footwear phenomenon. It is a business with strong management.
I like the stock. We'll see where it goes. I lightened the position because it has not moved much lately,
and think there are better opportunities. I still believe there is some bite left in this stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 9 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 45 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costco stock has been good to me since I bought my first share in 2023. I took some profits from $949-$1034 per share. 
The business is so impressive to me. I'm a fan and a shareholder. Sometimes I get to visit by knowing someone who is 
a member, what a treat. The $1.50 hotdog is a shining beacon of corporate strategy at its finest. 
The Costco team is crushing it and people love the store. I'm going to be a shareholder, maybe forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 6 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 9 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BABA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a bit overweight in this Chinese stock. So far, I'm in the green with profits on the position.
This is the Chinese hyperscaler infrastructure play. It has a better case that it is undervalued compared to 
the US hyperscalers. I'm bullish on Baba and could see it being a $200 stock someday. Staying long my ADRs and
collecting my dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 18 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 75 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;META&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold a chunk of Meta shares to raise money. Bullish on their ads business and ability to use AI to improve its
effectiveness. Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram. Meta is flashing cash to build an AI superteam. Who knows how it
will shake out, but Meta will be there competing with AI. Lightened position because I needed extra cash. Believe we will
see Meta stock at $1000 per share someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 3 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 7 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOOG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to make a slight trim of shares I bought at $180 before their earnings report. I regretted it because 
the sentiment has flipped somewhat bullish recently. This sell is more about leveling this to even with my 
Meta and Spotify investments. YouTube ad revenue is running up. Search revenue is still growing. 
Playing in the data center space. Cloud computing grew 28% year over year in the most recent quarter. 
Gemini has 450 million users, including me. Waymo is growing, solidifying Google's leadership in autonomous taxis.
All bullish indicators. Google is still winning. The trillion dollar question is what will happen to their
profit stream of search in the future, which will need to be defended against new AI competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 4 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 26 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMZN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hyperscaler. Investing in Anthropic. Has Zoox in the autonomous taxi space. The godfather of e-commerce with 
an ads business and streaming. Bezo's baby. C'mon it's Amazon! Yet another cloud computing competitor in AWS. Lots to like. 
I added 3 shares in April at $171. In July, I sold 3 shares that I bought in my taxable brokerage at $228. Essentially 
my share count remained the same, but my cost basis was reduced by approximately $150 with this maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 3 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 14 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari makes one less car than the market demands to always ensure a full order book. I like that it's an
international, European equity. I already am heavily invested in several automakers and lightened up to raise funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 1 Share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 3 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to lock in some long term profits around $500. I sold 5 shares around $485 at the cost 
I bought them at in an attempt to trade short term. Should have held them all! I ended up buying back 2 shares recently.
Hyper bullish on this stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 10 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 17 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MELI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This payments company runs like water through South America. I was overweight at the beginning of the year, so I used
it as a source of funds for living expenses. I'm wishing I kept more MercadoLibre shares, but have conviction to keep what I have
and add on any big dips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 5 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 2 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's theme parks are a cash machine. Its streaming service is now profitable. Its intellectual property is loved globally 
from Mickey and Minnie to the Pixar universe and beyond. In 2024, it had the top 2 theatrical releases with Deadpool and Wolverine
and Inside Out 2. Marvel is still a big draw. They are finalizing a deal with Fubo to solidify the live sports offering in addition to ESPN.
I had bought more heavily the past few years, and felt overweight here, so I've reduced my share count now that stock has bounced up above $120. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 18 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 43 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realty Income is a REIT that won't blow you away with growth. The monthly dividend income is a fun twist on investing.
I lightened up on my taxable brokerage position, and bought some in my Roth IRA where the dividends will enjoy tax advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 27 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 75 shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been holding Toyota ADRs for years. I trimmed my higher cost lots,
but will remain long. Since 2020, Toyota has sold more than 52 million cars at an average price of $32,000.
The quarterly dividend is a nice bonus also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 10 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 20 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PINS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinterest shares have always shown promise to me. After 4 years, it has yet to come to fruition. I'm still underwater on my shares.
I took out some of my invested capital at cost more or less for this reason. The promise is still there, with a company that is actively using
and developing new AI capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 10 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 40 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AAPL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been holding a small bag of Apple shares, because its cellular ecosystem is fine tuned to reap profits.
However, the obvious problem with the stock now is that they have no AI momentum. They're behind.
I am not holding much Apple individually, but have more exposure in my S&amp;amp;P 500 fund. I took 1 share off
because I don't like how the company operates with developers and its app store practices. Plus, they missed the boat on AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 1 Share&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 5 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XYZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got fed up with Block after buying the top in 2021 and buying the dip since. I sold out at a loss. Complete exit. 
Not much good to say about Square, I mean Block, after holding for 4 years. Good riddance. After I sold out, 
it was added to the S&amp;amp;P 500, so I guess I will ride the upside in my S&amp;amp;P fund if it ever materializes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 20 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 0 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENPH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solar stocks have mostly gone down and decreased the value of my investments. I believe in solar, but the industry seems 
to settling out with winners and losers. I decided to close out my entire position in Enphase Energy. I couldn't justify 
staying invested with low conviction when so many better companies are out there. Earnings reports seemed to always disappoint.
Took a loss and closed out this solar bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 40 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 0 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FSLR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trimming on my solar allocation. Solar is facing some negative headwinds thanks to President Trump's big beautiful bill.
Staying long First Solar as my only solar investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 6 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 10 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TSLA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I caught the wave of Tesla finding profitability from 2019 to 2021. I'm trimming my exposure by taking profits
after a wild ride the past 6 years. I'm keeping the rest as a long term hold. I will be monitoring 
the robotaxi expansion and optimus progress dilligently. Hopefully auto sales will pick back up to help
support its unconventional valuation. Tesla isn't just a car company. It will be so much more according to Elon.
Never bet against Elon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold: 99 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining: 106 Shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past performance is not indicative of future returns. These stocks and my convictions are not financial advice.
Research, learn and invest at your own risk. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Entering and Exiting a Position Slowly Over Time</title><link href="https://divbull.com/entering-and-exiting-a-position-slowly-over-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-07-24T16:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-07-24T16:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-07-24:/entering-and-exiting-a-position-slowly-over-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Often investors make the mistake of the "all or nothing" fallacy.

to be the error of thinking you need to go "all in" heavy all at once, and sell out 
for profit by exiting a position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My investing reality does not function this way. I find I will often buy and sell stocks 
intermittently over time, lowering or buying more and raising my exposure based on recent events, 
earnings reports and price movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it becomes clear that a company has negative headwinds, so I might lighten up. 
Otherwise, if a trend like AI presents itself as an opportunity, I tend to lean in to that trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I bought more Spotify. It's the first time since I added more shares at $403 in Nov. 2024. 
I sold 3 shares earlier this year at an average of $500 to lock in profits, but have since wanted 
to invest more in a winning stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've now bought Spotify stock in a range of $75 to $685 per share. Up at this high level, I'm not 
adding heavily. I picked up 2 shares, 1 of which was the first in my Roth IRA. My share count is now up to 17.
I was aiming to bring Spotify to an invested capital level on par with my Meta and Google investments. 
In my view, this is a high conviction hold that has earned its spot among tech's elite companies.
However, such a high price implies risk should their impressive growth slow. I may regret adding Spotify at such a high valuation.
Or maybe I'll wish I added more, which tends to happen with this international technology stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business looks strong, with estimated over 700 million monthly active users. Sometimes, we 
should look to add to our winners. In my opinion, Spotify has proven it is a winner. Their gamechanging 
music streaming model growth story and focus on a best in class music player product has paid off.
Assuming the executive team is able to continue its stellar performance, I believe the stock is going higher.
Just one month ago, it reached all time high of $785. I bought this stock today at $100 less than its market price only 30 days ago. 
It seems the business can support this lofty valuation and has the potential to grow even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my Tesla investment, I've been lowering my cost basis, trimming profits by selling shares I bought at higher lots
along with the original lot of shares I bought at $17. I have "house money" riding in the stock. 
I added and reduced my position at various times. I sold 76% of my total Tesla stake over the past 
3 years, locking in a tidy amount of profits. I want to hang on to my last 100 shares for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta have become a measuring bar for me.
Do I think this can achieve better returns than the "hyperscalers"? If not, I probably won't add or 
maybe might lighten up a position. Typically, I will only do this when I need to pay taxes or raise 
cash for living expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the only stock I've never sold a share of is Microsoft. This is very rare, but it has been 
my highest conviction play in the past 5 years. It worked out great, with some lucky timing to catch the AI trend. 
This is more exception than the norm. Typically, I will be leveling a stock position over time in line with where 
I see suitable levels of invested capital versus other stocks. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>The ETF Bias</title><link href="https://divbull.com/the-etf-bias.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-25T13:50:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-06-25T13:50:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-06-25:/the-etf-bias.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are tons of financial professionals and retail investors out there who drink the ETF kool-aid.

Most parrot the same general rhetoric: "don't touch individual stocks, you'll get burned".
Everyone knows that ETFs and mutual funds are a safe bet. Don't mess with individual stocks,
DCA into index funds. We've all had this hammered into our heads countless times when we consider investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ETF bias tries to convince you that individual stocks are too risky. A 3 fund approach 
is a common strategy. Ultimately, you want to hold a mix of large/small caps and domestic/international stocks. 
If you are approaching retirement increase how much is in bonds, money market funds or treasury bills.
This target allocation can be achieved with both passive funds and individual stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that the financial industry has a bias against individual stock picking, perhaps 
because it is difficult to succeed. However, financial pros and bogleheads often write off stockpicking 
as being like going to the casino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that it's easy to lose money by picking a bad stock at the wrong time. I've picked 
plenty of losers. But if you choose well, you can ride a stock's momentum for a long time, beat 
the market and make gains multiples higher than a passive approach. With stockpicking, you 
might need to be more dilligent in taking profits to reduce your downside risk. This active nature 
is not desirable to fund oriented investors. For those who don't mind the time to be hands on, 
this gives more granular control of your risk exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, you should own the market. My 5th largest position currently is an S&amp;amp;P 500 
index fund. I'm not suggesting we should abandon ETFs and mutual funds. Instead, keep your eyes 
open to stocks that are set for a 15-20 year run of an ongoing growth trend. Investing is not 
"all or nothing". You can take some small shots at a company that has the potential to give multi-bagger 
returns. Don't let the ETF bias convince you to buy the market and stay 100% passive. Find a Netflix 
before it disrupted the media game. Find an Apple when it drops a smartphone
that changed the cell phone market forever. Get into Nintendo before its Switch 2 becomes the greatest
selling console of all time. These types of moves plus some lucky timing can win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently long at least 5 stocks that beat the market over the past 5 years. My bets on Cloudflare, 
Nvidia, Microsoft, Spotify and Tesla all beat the market in that time span. If I listened to 
the "play it safe" crowd, I would have missed out on these multi-bagger gains. Sure, Microsoft and Nvidia 
are two of the largest companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 so I'm still somewhat correlated there with the S&amp;amp;P 500. 
I'm happy to have higher exposure to these incredible companies in the early innings of the AI trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, for some investors they view researching companies and trying to assess their quality as 
unnecessary burden. I view it as an activity that I enjoy that makes me money when I excel. While 
I appreciate the "set it and forget it" nature of index funds and ETFs, I find the challenge of 
stockpicking to be like an enjoyable hobby. Personal finance truly is personal. You should discover 
where your risk tolerance falls on the spectrum. I might have survivor bias from some lucky picks, 
but I stand on my ETF thesis. Don't let the ETF bias convince you it's impossible to pick stocks and win. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Earning Interest on Your Bitcoin With Bonded Staking</title><link href="https://divbull.com/earning-interest-on-your-bitcoin-with-bonded-staking.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-22T10:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-06-22T10:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-06-22:/earning-interest-on-your-bitcoin-with-bonded-staking.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kraken Introduces Bonded Bitcoin Staking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently achieved a new passive income stream by tapping into my long Bitcoin holdings.
Thanks to Kraken's new &lt;a href="https://support.kraken.com/articles/overview-of-bitcoin-staking-on-kraken"&gt;bonded Bitcoin staking&lt;/a&gt;
I'm now earning 0.25%-1% APR in interest against my Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, Bitcoin required "bridging" to other assets or other more complex maneuvers in order to earn 
staking rewards. For comparison, Ethereum and Solana have native staking. Bitcoin is now able to earn 
staking rewards without needing to leave its native blockchain. The rewards are earned in exchange 
for securing the network by locking up your assets for up to 7 days before you can unstake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a significant win for me. It's a new income stream that Kraken has enabled that I previously didn't have. 
I estimate my Bitcoin holdings would yield approximately $175 per year if I could achieve a 1% yield. 
The exciting part is the compounding this could enable by reinvesting the earnings back into Bitcoin 
or other assets. Potentially, my payouts will grow over time as my bitcoin holdings increase. I'm 35 years old, 
so this means I might invest an extra ~$5,000 of earnings into Bitcoin by the time I'm 70. This estimate assumes 
I live that long, stay invested, earn close to 1% and continue to reinvest the staking rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what Bitcoin's price does, I'll continue to earn rewards. I don't plan to sell any Bitcoin anytime soon.
So the 7 day lockup associated with unbonding does not worry me at all. Someday, I might reduce holdings to diversify 
and reallocate elsewhere, but I believe I'll hold Bitcoin for the rest of my life. I might as well earn yield against this asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How It Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kraken has teamed up with the Babylon protocol to allow Bitcoin holders to collect staking rewards against your sats.
It took my Bitcoin about 45 minutes to transfer into Kraken. Once on the exchange, it's very easy to "allocate" 
your Bitcoin to bonded staking. It only takes a few minutes to do. Go to the "Earn" page and click a button 
to allocate to bonded staking. Once you've done this, you'll receive a weekly payout in BABY tokens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first payout was $0.21, about 4.9 BABY coins. One quirk of holding the BABY tokens is that you need to 
accumulate about 25 tokens before you can convert the tokens back into Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kraken does take a commission on your earnings, which tends to be about 16-20% for smaller stakes. You can read
more details about the fees &lt;a href="https://support.kraken.com/articles/360037682011-overview-of-staking-on-kraken"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an awesome opportunity that Kraken has enabled for extra passive income against the king of crypto assets.
If you're holding Bitcoin, do some research into yield opportunities for your holdings. It can potentially 
become a new income stream.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>The Solar Narrative Vs. The Stocks</title><link href="https://divbull.com/the-solar-narrative-vs-the-stocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-17T11:45:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-06-17T11:45:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-06-17:/the-solar-narrative-vs-the-stocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In its 2024 Q2 and Q3 earnings reports, Enphase Energy had an optimistic tone on their earnings call.

This …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In its 2024 Q2 and Q3 earnings reports, Enphase Energy had an optimistic tone on their earnings call.
The solar system installer looked ahead to 2025, expecting interest rate cuts to come from the Fed. 
The confidence of their executive team suggested they would thrive in the coming environment. 
This turned out to be a solar flare. It was the light at the end of the tunnel that dissipated, 
failing to come to fruition. Why? Will solar stocks finally rip to the moon when the proverbial rate cuts arrive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one predicted that Trump would unleash his tariff driven policy in 2025, 
which raised the cost of materials to build their solar rigs. The other thing 
that we didn't see coming was the repeal of solar credits by the United States government.
Additionally, no one predicted that President Trump would demand rate cuts and even 
threaten to fire Chairman Powell from the Fed. This has seemingly had a reverse effect 
of what Trump wanted, as now the Fed has become paralyzed to an extent 
while they survey the chaos that Trump has reaped in his first 6 months as president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 3 conditions, a lack of rate cuts, tariffs to increase business costs and removal 
of solar government subsidies in Trump's "big beautiful bill", created a solar storm for 
companies competing in this energy space. The long term view is that solar will be a necessary 
piece to feed our society's energy needs. However, the narrative has detached from the business 
reality. The removal of government credits will put these solar companies to the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I sold out of my Enphase Energy shares at $48, taking a substantial loss. 
I had been buying the dip since $140. In May 2024, I sold out of my Sunrun shares at $12, 
taking a slightly smaller but still significant loss. I sold out of both because I believed 
that they could go lower based on shaky business fundamentals. Recently, that has been the case.
This morning, Enphase Energy shares are priced at $33, down -23%. Sunrun shares are priced at $5.73,
down -40% this morning on the solar credit termination news. Bankruptcy appears to be a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, solar was a great investment idea. In practice, it was not for me. Perhaps 
I could chalk it up to poor timing, mediocre stock picking and unlucky policy. After owning for 
approximately 2 years, I harvested the losses to lower my tax bill. In retrospect, this prevented 
another $1,062 of capital loss had I held on. My total realized loss from solar investments is $3,369.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I'm only holding a small position in First Solar (FSLR) to invest in the solar industry. 
In my opinion, this company is the most likely to succeed of the 3 companies I had invested in, 
so I kept my shares. I hope to stay invested for a long time. It's currently down -16% on the 
solar credit news, not as bad as the ENPH and RUN. It seems to have the strongest fundamentals 
after following these 3 companies since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical nuance of investing in Solar is to distinguish whether the business competes in 
commercial or residential solar. Enphase and Sunrun are more exposed to the residential solar customer. 
The subsidy revisions in the recent tax bill imply a larger hit to the companies in the residential sector. 
The moves in ENPH and RUN confirmed by dropping more than others who compete in commercial solar, like 
First Solar. It's easy to want to "invest in solar" without considering that residential home installation 
solar companies might be less efficient than large scale commercial operations. This wasn't obvious 
to me when I started buying solar stocks. It's a nugget of wisdom gleaned from my solar follies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can be right about a general trend like solar, it is less likely that I'll  pick the 
"winners" that make it long term in this industry. Therefore, I've reduced my solar exposure 
for now. If I feel the industry sentiment improving, I'll buy more of a solar energy 
ETF like the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the long term solar narrative is unaffected, the businesses competing in this space are 
undergoing growing pains. The subsidies they've grown dependent on are being taken away. 
Will they survive? Some will, and some will not. That's the reality of business.
There is always risk in investing. Threats can come from government action. In this case, 
a policy reversal spelled doom for solar stocks. Some of them will likely recover in the long term, 
but that is not much consolation for investors. Maybe I got what I deserved, investing in an industry 
more reliant on the government, when that government is cutting clean energy subsidies and raising interest rates,
while other energy sources like nuclear remain uncut.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Tesla Valuation, Fundamentals and Vibes</title><link href="https://divbull.com/tesla-valuation-fundamentals-and-vibes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-04T04:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-06-04T04:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-06-04:/tesla-valuation-fundamentals-and-vibes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tesla is unique company.

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals-based investors get squeamish when they dig into Tesla's financials. The valuation of Tesla often 
struggles to hold up against its actual fundamentals. Because of this, a 50% drawdown is not uncommon for the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory of Tesla stock is that you can't look at it this way. It is a "story stock", with levers in AI, autonomous driving robotaxis and the transition to renewable energy backing it. Tesla trades on vibes and stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are a profitable at a time when the electric vehicle (EV) movement is pumping the brakes. Long term, I believe Tesla will be competitive in EVs, but it is getting tougher for them with more competitors entering the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla had the "first mover" advantage in EVs and parlayed it into a profitable business with many potential new levers of growth. Nowadays, it is a more risky bet given how its valuation has swollen since 2019. I have sold down the position to below a 10% allocation in my portfolio to hedge my downside risk if robotaxis don't pan out. I wouldn't recommend the stock in 2025, given what I've known from being an investor for 6 years. But could there be more money to be made on the stock? Ultimately, that's what investors want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that Tesla is its own animal. Someday, it will likely be thriving in robotics and autonomous driving. When you consider Tesla as an investor, you need to consider the vibes and the story. Admittedly, it is risky to invest this way. That's why more disciplined investors have scoffed at its prospects as an investment ever since I first bought the stock 6 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Tesla, you need to look at the company wholistically. Watch where it's heading in the long run. Stay invested for the long run. This has been the pattern historically that has paid faithful investors, but past returns are no indication of future results. You need to read the vibes and put the fundamentals on the back shelf if you are researching Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>REIT Tax Strategy for Minimizing Your Tax Bill</title><link href="https://divbull.com/reit-tax-strategy-for-minimizing-your-tax-bill.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-06-02T14:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-06-02T14:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-06-02:/reit-tax-strategy-for-minimizing-your-tax-bill.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am always learning in investing.

Recently I've been reading into different cases of optimizing assets by keeping them in the right account. Placing different assets in the proper type of account can have a huge impact on your net worth down the road by reducing your tax bill. Certain assets are best suited for a 401(k), some for a tax advantaged Roth IRA and the rest into a taxable brokerage account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, I decided I wanted to invest in a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) to diversify my portfolio into real estate. By owning a REIT, you collect the income from a portfolio of rental properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.realtyincome.com/"&gt;Realty Income (O)&lt;/a&gt;. It yields a monthly dividend, which I've reinvested back into my position. So far, it's been a steady place to keep a 1.4% position size in this turbulent year. As of today, I'm slightly in the green in profits. In their Q1 earnings report on May 5th, Realty Income mentioned it is the 7th largest REIT globally. They also pointed out that they have 98.5% portfolio occupancy, so nearly 99% of their properties are being actively rented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We owned or held interests in 15,627 properties, which were leased to 1,598 clients doing business in 91 industries."
- Q1 2025 Realty Income Earnings Call&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading online, I found that REITs are required to pass through 90% of their taxable income to shareholders. This gives them a different tax classification. The dividends REITs yield are "non-qualified dividends" which are part of your taxable income. This means that REITs are best suited for a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA to keep more of your dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I discovered this REIT tax nuance, I bought Realty Income in my taxable brokerage account. Now, I'm contemplating how I will shift my REIT holding into my Roth IRA. From what I've researched online, I would need to sell the position and re-buy in my Roth IRA. It is ok to keep a REIT in your taxable brokerage if you want to yield money you can use immediately.
However, the tax hit on your dividends will be substantial in a taxable brokerage account. You'll also pay a higher tax on the dividends if you earn more from your salary or business, depending which tax bracket you fall into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For new investors, the key concept here is that certain assets are better suited for your tax advantaged accounts. Another example of this that I realized recently is that holding bonds in a Roth IRA negates the tax advantage of the Roth. Bonds are best suited for a 401(k). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of REITs, they are subject to higher tax rates versus typical dividend stocks. Therefore, if you want to invest in a REIT, you can keep more of your gains over the long run and maximize compounding by putting your REIT in a tax advantaged Roth IRA.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Stocks I Sold Out of That Became Multibaggers</title><link href="https://divbull.com/stocks-i-sold-out-of-that-became-multibaggers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-26T11:38:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-05-26T11:38:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-05-26:/stocks-i-sold-out-of-that-became-multibaggers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been buying and selling stocks for about 8 years.

Occasionally I will prune my stock portfolio. Sometimes the stocks I sold moved further down in price. 
On 3 occasions, I've sold a stock and it went on to achieve greater than 100% return. It's painful for me to review,

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided I didn't want to invest in the "next Starbucks". Even though the business is growing healthily, I decided 
I prefer other opportunities. People seem passionate about their Dutch Bros drinks. I misread the stock and could have doubled my money if I bought instead of selling out in 2024 at $29.50 for a measly $7 profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PBPB, +248%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my first stock picks was a good one in hindsight. However, my inexperience caused me to doubt the future of this sandwich shop chain. Checking back 5 years later, I was shocked to see how the stock had done. I sold the bottom at $2.89 in 2020. If I had stayed the course instead of bailing after 4 months, I would have tripled my money within 5 years. Instead I sold out at a ~$300 loss, flushing away what would have been a $1,700 gain today at the current price of $9.88.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PLTR, +408%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only held one share of Palantir for 6 months in 2021. I saw the stock constantly being discussed online and threw in $23. That share is now worth $124. Their dependency on government business contracts seemed a turn-off to me. I sold. I get that now they have the AI story as well. This is a promising company for sure, but I won't be purchasing shares at such a high valuation. At least my S&amp;amp;P 500 position gives me some exposure to Palantir's upside, so I caught the gains since they were added in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody Gets It Right Every Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My read on these stocks was incorrect. I could have made money in them if I worked up more conviction. However,
sometimes I just feel a stock is not the right type of business for me. I am not interested in what Palantir is doing.
Also, there's no guarantees Dutch Bros will make it, but it seems they're executing at a high level currently.
I'm happy for these businesses to succeed. Potbelly was not an obvious winner stock to me, but now I can see with the benefit of time, it actually beat the market. It appears they're doing something right. Those are the types of unexpected winners that stock pickers dream about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Stocks I Sold That Went Down More Than 50%</title><link href="https://divbull.com/stocks-i-sold-that-went-down-more-than-50.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-05-22T13:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-05-22T13:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-05-22:/stocks-i-sold-that-went-down-more-than-50.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, you will be holding stocks that you should sell.

&lt;li&gt;DNUT, -51%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered Krispy Kreme Donuts for a short term trade to medium term investment. This was an ill-fated move. I instantly became a bagholder from $13, bought the dip a few times under $10. After seeing my questionable pick, I sold half of my shares early in the trade at a loss at $10.45, a good move in hindsight. Still, I bought the dip when the price dipped below $9. After 3 quarters of following the earnings reports, the donuts started to smell a little funky to me. Add in that the brand is not owned by its original owners, but a venture capital firm who bought them privately to then return to flounder in public markets. The business isn't as hot and fresh as its donuts. They failed to turn a profit in this most recent quarter and the past 2 reports stunk it up. Management put a lot of its chips in the McDonalds partnership growth lever, which seems to have fizzled out. My losses were sizable, but thankfully I had the sense to get out at $6 before this tumbled below $3. In total, this little maneuver cost me $1,382. I would be in worse shape holding my Krispy Kreme bags today, given the state of the company and diving stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;TDC, -51.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company was a short-term trade of which I knew so little about the company, Teradata. Traded a small $100-$150 position and closed at a small profit. Really not sure why I messed with this stock. It was a good move to kick it out of my portfolio, seeing it has lost half its value looking back to when I traded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RUN, -53%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunrun is a solar installer that lacked fundamentals. Their dependence on solar credits and flimsy durability in tough times made this a poor investment. I sold out at $12. Looking back, I believe it was the right call. I couldn't have known that the United States government would increase the cost of materials with tariffs and strip away solar subsidies in 2025, dealing a knockout blow to Sunrun. Today, shares trade at $5.73, at less than half their value when I sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UA, -58%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Armor was one of my first stock picks. It was a terrible pick. I was only invested in the stock for 4 months. I felt the general sentiment was awful around their earnings reports. 2017 was a difficult year for the company. I sold out of my 30 shares in 2017 above $14 at a -22% loss. I couldn't justify choosing this company over Nike and didn't have much conviction due to negative operating sentiment. Suffice to say it's been a rough decade for athletic wear stocks. Looking back, with more patience I could have waited a few years to sell at breakeven or a small profit. However, checking back 8 years later, the stock is worth $6. Staying long UA from 2017 would have been a negative ROI, with more than half the investment value lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LYFT, -64%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in an &lt;a href="https://divbull.com/getting-out-of-lyft-stock"&gt;earlier post on this blog&lt;/a&gt; about my wise move to exit at $35-$55. The price currently sits at $16. In their case, it didn't pay to be 
number 2 in the rideshare industry. More competition ramps up soon with Waymo delivering 250K rides 
and Tesla beginning its rollout in June. I closed out my Lyft position for a $600+ loss. Similar to Krispy Kreme, I took the losses to lower my taxable income. In both stocks, I would be sitting on much larger losses if I kept my shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API, -69%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the boom times of 2021, I impulsively bought the dip on the company that made Clubhouse. I bought Agora stock during Clubhouse's 15 minutes of fame moment after the pandemic. Remember Clubhouse? It's an audio service that offered live community chat audio rooms. It was not a good stock to hold since 2021. Fortunately, I kept my losses limited to $194, so it's not as deep a flesh wound as some other stocks have made. The stock has been sliding downhill ever since I got in above $90 and added on further drops. In the end, I tax harvested the losses and sold out at an average of $7. The current price is $3.59 so this beaten down stock did have room to fall even more. It was an odd bet to make that I didn't really think through. China exposure adds more risk here also. I think the lesson from this trade is that when a stock is having a moment of ultra hype and fame, don't get caught up in the flurry too much. I believe that is what happened to me when Clubhouse was having its moment. I also, being a developer, was attracted to the ticker "API". I thought I saw something disruptive happening in the audio space. The better audio investment choice would have been to add to my Spotify position. Fortunately, I don't often treat the stock market like a casino, and when I do, I typically don't bet a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CGC, -76%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to invest in the marijuana boom, and Canopy Growth was one of the best known options to play the trend 5 years ago. This trade is runner-up for my worst investment outcome. The business is run like it's management's own personal credit card account. They're nowhere near profitable, and no signs of a turnaround. I rode this stock down too far and made the mistake of adding when it tanked. In the end, it was a $1,052 mistake that cost me most of my investment after holding for 3 years. The silver lining is that I did sell at a local high exiting at $7 before it dropped another 76% to below $2. I was so sick of this company by the time I sold, I felt a huge relief to no longer be holding. Good riddance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MTCH, -81%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I entered Match Group thinking it must be a high-margin business. It holds my personal record for the shortest time I've ever held an investment at 1 month and 3 days from open to close. Tinder, Hinge, Match.com and OKCupid are pinnacles of single dating life. Match Group has the market cornered it seems. However, I had no conviction in the idea nor the interest to understand the economics of dating apps. Then consider the fact that a dating app that does its job, connecting 2 people to start a relationship, causes Match to lose 2 users everytime it succeeds. In retrospect, it was the right move to move on from being a dating app investor. I sold my 3 shares at an average of $158 to cash in $5 of profits before the bottom fell out of this stock. It now trades around $29. Sometimes the best wins are the shots you don't take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EB, -89%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventbright was a well-known startup in the ZIRP era. They pop up occasionally in ticketing for events I attend. I only owned 1 share, which I bought and sold above $20 for a tidy $0.67 profit. The pandemic was a huge setback to their business and the stock reflects that thesis today. The market price as of today hovers around $2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BYND, -97.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Meat rode a wave that turned out to be more of a fad. Veggie meat pops up occasionally at the restaurant. There are other products in this category, but it seems the demand for this type of food was overestimated. The position was small, 7 shares. Thankfully I didn't hang onto this one. I closed out the position at a $114 average for a $138 profit. I sold because it was low conviction to believe in the fake meat industry. Today it is priced under $3, so I made the right call to get out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BRDS, -100%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not often you will sell a stock and it actually ends up going to zero. I now can now tell the story of accomplishing this rare feat and have a little chuckle about the disaster. Foolishly, I was playing a trade for a bounce in a scooter company. This is my dumbest trade/investment idea ever. I simply didn't know what I was investing in. I saw some "merger" news that sounded bullish for them to become the largest scooter company in the USA via an acquisition of the scooter startup "Spin". "Why not own the #1 scooter rideshare company?", I thought. I had seen both Bird and Spin operating in cities like Denver and St. Louis. So I threw $200 in on a whim. The "news" (stock pump piece) of them becoming the #1 biggest scooter company in America was actually a precursor to "restructuring" and bankruptcy. I ignored the warning messaged from my broker not to buy the shares and bought in, looking for a comeback story. Bad news hit days after I bought shares. The company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange for having too small of a market cap. The ticker moved to over the counter (OTC) exchange and the ticker was later changed from BRDS to BRDSQ. I averaged down on my shares on the OTC, hoping to break even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;We firmly believe that BRDS current market cap does not reflect the intrinsic value of the Company,&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Michael&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Washinushi&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Bird&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;s interim CEO, was quoted as saying in the statement on Friday. &amp;quot;And while disappointing, this change in our listing status on the NYSE does not alter our commitment to our shareholders, our valued employees across Bird and Spin, our partners and the many global cities and institutions with which we work.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;/- CNBC, https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/22/scooter-company-bird-delisted-from-nyse-will-trade-over-the-counter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message from the business was that they were staying the course, rebuilding with the Spin acquisition, and "committed to our shareholders". It turned out the acquisition was a facade to hide Bird's rotten core. After getting some skin in the game, I was eyeing the upcoming earnings call to learn more about what was going on with this mysterious business. Little did I know, the executives had no intention to host the call. When they made a surprise late night blog post announcement to "restructure" assets and reconcile with creditors, I set my sell order. I didn't want to be left holding the empty bag. Thankfully I had subscribed to the company website via RSS feed so I immediately saw the news. My final trade executed at open at $0.26 to sell 500 shares I had bought anticipating a recovery. After I sold it all, that day it plunged to below $0.10. I managed to get out at a -79% loss, losing $490. It was small bet that resulted in stunningly huge % short term losses in only 3 months from open to close of the trade. I deserved it for not doing my homework. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selling at open the day after the bankruptcy news broke, I avoided the fall to zero and walked away with $129. Bird Global is no longer a publicly traded company, and no value was returned to shareholders due to all assets absorbed in repaying the scooter company's creditors. I still see their scooters in operation occasionally when I visit random cities. They have likely been absorbed by other scooter companies if they are still running or are still operating some places. The website still is live. If you search Bird scooters in the news, you'll see various cities are still kicking them out of town to this day. It's a constant reminder to me that good stocks will work for you and the worst stocks actually take from you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Short Term Pain, Tariffs and Uncertainty in Stocks</title><link href="https://divbull.com/short-term-pain-tariffs-and-uncertainty-in-stocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-03-11T20:31:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-03-11T20:31:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-03-11:/short-term-pain-tariffs-and-uncertainty-in-stocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;2025 has begun with a bang and a pop (of equities).

hellbent on torching the portfolios of investors in the name of "short term pain".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncertainty of the situation has cast a dark shadow over the stock market. Maybe the market was overly frothy after 2 years of
excellent returns. The policies of the government seemingly exacerbated the situation to create a sense of dread over the
business world. Tariffs mean change. Businesses will need to adapt, possibly raise prices, and sales might be affected.
The stock market is pretty good at finding a catalyst to move in the direction it feels, and Trump became that catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a case of overhyped expectations crashing to reality. When President Trump was elected in November,
the initial reaction was to forecast blue skies and green pastures. The man who took office has not delivered on that lofty,
euphoric and evidently misguided vision. Or maybe he will, but it will take some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that "short term pain" is very frightening to investors. How long is short term? How much pain will there be?
We don't have the answers. We don't know how this will play out. There may be some industries and countries hit harder than others.
Some companies will pay the price for Trump's trade war. Some people will literally pay more money for the things 
they want and need because of these policies and the clumsy manner in which they are being rolled out, delayed 
and retracted as bargaining chips, inciting our allies and opponents alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are truly long term investors, we should not change our strategy because of the tariff environment. However, I have taken
some chips off the table because of what has happened. I have not changed my core strategy, but I did close out 1 underperforming 
stock at a loss. It was in the retail sector as an international brand that specifically has the name "American" in it. 
I suspect there could be animosity towards American branded products in other countries. There is the possibility 
that some countries around the world will see our president's actions as distasteful and choose not to buy American products. 
Who knows if this will come to fruition, but it already seems to be the case with brands like Tesla noting sales dropped 
considerably in Germany and Norway in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took a few bites out of some long term holds that are more susceptible to retrace their multi-bagger gains in this environment. 
However, I only sold a marginal amount of my positions to help pay my tax bill and living expenses. I'm still long with the bulk of my shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the tariffs are done to balance the trade deficit of the USA. As a fiscally conservative American,
I appreciate the motive behind these tariffs. I want us to close the trade deficit. However, the way we're going about this is disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not changing my investing strategy, but I am bracing for a rough year. I hope it won't be that painful, but I'm prepared to ride it out
for those long term gains we've been promised. We hate the uncertainty, but that doesn't mean we quit investing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Power Ranking Reddit Investment Subreddits</title><link href="https://divbull.com/power-ranking-reddit-investment-subreddits.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-02-19T04:20:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-02-19T04:20:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-02-19:/power-ranking-reddit-investment-subreddits.html</id><content type="html">&lt;ol&gt;

However, it is not always going to work out sharing your ideas with friends, family or people you know. The reason is that you can't share your conviction to hold when the price dips. Paper hands get shaken out. You may have diamond hands, but not everyone will be able to wait until the diamond is fully formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People panic. People don't understand what they're invested in. In conditions where asset prices are dipping, they cave in and sell.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you can't really talk about stocks with the average joe. They won't stay in the game long enough to win. Or they'll take profits too early.
Even in something as proven over time as the S&amp;amp;P 500, people will start to doubt it unless they are seasoned investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we need to cut our losses in investing. Other times, we just need to wait longer for a rebound. When faced with this circumstance, being able to discern which right road to take is never guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is you can't help someone become a great investor. They have to earn it. I've realized not everyone has that in them and that's ok. Those people are best suited to buy index funds or real estate. You can share stock ideas with people, but you won't always be there to reassure them to hold
through the tough times. I've fallen victim to my own miscalculations and sold at the wrong time. It happens. If you get your investment moves right consistently enough, the times you messed up won't matter as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who was fortunate to have some early success with stocks, I wanted to share my thought process and what worked for me.
I started this blog for the sake of sharing openly how I process my investing journey. Nothing written here is financial advice.
It is a window into my own mind of investing that I choose to share. Could be useful or not. Ultimately, you can't make someone believe in stocks. 
They have to realize the belief themselves. Stocks go up over time. Will you stick around and bet on that or take your ball and go home?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Seeing the Bigger Picture</title><link href="https://divbull.com/seeing-the-bigger-picture.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-01-22T21:10:00-06:00</published><updated>2025-01-22T21:10:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2025-01-22:/seeing-the-bigger-picture.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In investing, we get it wrong sometimes.

Investing in single stocks is a constant reassessment. Just because you made a mistake in the past, doesn't mean you have to live with it forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I treated my Netflix (NFLX) position like a trade. I took some profits above $500 in 2021. Life was good. Foolishly, I began to doubt the security of the business when the stock suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/10/14/why-netflix-is-down-60-this-year/"&gt;60% drawdown in 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always thought I had strong conviction to hold through bad times, but I'd never seen a stock move like Netflix did in 2022. And it wasn't just Netflix that suffered that year. Most of the stocks in my portfolio went through corrections or more extreme drawdowns. I started to look at each of my stocks and think, which of these can I really trust? I was a bit scared of seeing more stocks sell off. It definitely affected me psychologically to see my frothy gains of 2021 slowly disappear by the end of 2022. In hindsight, this was the time to buy. I did buy a lot back then, but also made some mistakes. One of the biggest being Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I saw my portfolio under siege that year, I began to doubt how safe of an investment Netflix was. I lost sight of the big picture. Then I was thinking about how my position of 5 remaining shares was more than cut in half in a year. I started viewing my shares as a trade in terms of dollars rather than a company I own for the long term. This was my undoing. I believe this tension exists in the stock market for all of us. Am I a trader or an investor? That is decided by every move you make, buying or selling over time. In this case I was an investor who became a trader due to the extreme circumstances of losing money. It's an internal battle we all must be aware of when we buy stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscribers growth was falling, basically only for one quarter. (Another rookie mistake, putting too much emphasis on one quarter). Now the company says they won't even report quarterly subscriber numbers. Wavering subscriber number worries were the main reason I felt uncertainty. Now the company is shifting to focus on profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2023, 3 years after getting in, I had lost my conviction. I sold out my last Netflix share at $375 because I needed extra money and took a little last sliver of profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I no longer believed in the fundamentals because the stock price took a dive. For the first time in years, the growth was in question. Then, of course, it recovered. The stock went up 2-3x after I sold. It's been a hard lesson to learn. The silver lining is that the experience I gained might help me invest better in the future. Sometimes we lose sight of the big picture. Sometimes we flip from bull to bear. It happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in business school, we'd read case studies about Netflix and how they changed the media game. They started as a mail-in DVD company and adapted into streaming. It's a great story. I have a hypothesis that the companies that make the right moves that get written about in biz school case studies are the companies you want to own, as long as they're still dominating their market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the price skyrocketed over $100 in single trading day. Their recent Q4 earnings report showed strength. An impressive subscriber growth beat, price increases and growing live sports are positive catalysts. The big picture looks great for this company and they are growing on many facets. The difference is I was holding the stock again. It felt great to see the earnings report send shares soaring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month before the Q4 2024 slam dunk earnings report, I bought back in for 3 shares at $911. I decided I couldn't be on the wrong side of history anymore. I don't know what's going to happen next, but I know I want to own Netflix. This company is making the right moves. My gains aren't as big as if I had held onto my original lot, but it feels good to have some Netflix gains again. I see the big picture. This time if the stock drops big, I'll be buying more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Tesla is an Autonomous Vehicles Bet Now</title><link href="https://divbull.com/tesla-is-an-autonomous-vehicles-bet-now.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-05T03:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-09-05T03:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2024-09-05:/tesla-is-an-autonomous-vehicles-bet-now.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I began investing in Tesla (TSLA) in 2019, I bought the stock because I believed in electric vehicles.

They made sense to me. Someday, we'll be out of gas. We'll need electric vehicles. Stocks go up in the long run and demand for electric vehicles will grow in the future, so I made it a long term investment. I've been lucky enough to lock in multi-bagger profits along the way. Today, I am still heavily invested in the company. It's still my largest holding, at 17% of my investing portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla cornered the EV market in the early 2020s, growing its sales impressively. My stock soared. Tesla was overbought in 2021, before the EV wave fizzled out with interest rates jacked up. The stock's value was cut in half midway through 2024, 3 years after topping out during the pandemic money printing run. These days, electric vehicle sales are decelerating. Other automakers struggle to sell them profitably. Despite the Cybertruck being the best selling $100K+ truck, Teslas are less exceptional nowadays than they used to be. People who want to buy electric have other options besides the Model 3. But they still have a competitive advantage over legacy auto. China is a different story. Most likely, the government will tax the Chinese vehicles to help out American EV makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the company finds itself heading down a new road: autonomous vehicles. Elon himself said on the earnings calls, if you don't believe vehicles will drive themselves someday, sell the stock. The rise of the robotaxi is now what we investors are told to wait for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bet on Tesla is a bet on electric vehicles, robotaxis and some additional moonshots. In order for the stock price to hold up, they need the Cybercab to be unveiled and they'll need to grow other revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla changed the world by being the first profitable pure electric vehicle maker. The trillion dollar question is now... can they change the world again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have a convincing product with Full Self Driving (FSD) seemingly improving every month. But what are the real timelines we'll see for autonomous vehicles? Teslas may also face opposition from other motorists on the road. If no one is driving the car, will other drivers accept Teslas driving on the road and not interfere with them? Will lawmakers allow these cars to run the streets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo is already active in a small grid of California and Baidu (BIDU) is assisting Tesla with mapping in China. They also announced their &lt;a href="https://www.repairerdrivennews.com/2024/09/17/uber-and-waymo-partner-in-austin-and-atlanta/"&gt;Uber partnership is expanding to Austin and Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;. Will the world continue to shift to AI vehicles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the uncertainty of this line of new autonomous business, we should not count Tesla out. It's a company with many irons in the fire that could yield profits in the future. For example, 46% of Q2 net income came from Tesla's energy business, not from EVs. It also claims it's now using its Optimus robot in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure what the probability is that Tesla succeeds in autonomous vehicles. Because of this uncertainty, I've trimmed my stake and locked in a considerable amount of long term gains. I intend to remain invested in Tesla for the long run, unless the investment case changes substantially in some unexpected way. It is still the best stock I've ever owned so far in terms of returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla's robotaxi event on October 10th will hopefully tell us more about what our vehicles will or will not do in the future. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

More like buy, hold and make sure the business delivers value or sell. The question often comes up, "When do I sell?". This is unique to every investment and each investor's goals. For me, the baseline of the S&amp;amp;P 500 is a consideration. Do I think this stock can beat the returns of the S&amp;amp;P 500? If the answer is no, I probably will sell the stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've needed to raise money from my stock portfolio this year. More often, I chose to sell some underperforming stocks at a loss or small profit versus trimming the winners. Each of these stocks was held for at least 1-3 years until I decided to close the position. Here are stocks I sold out of recently and why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snowflake (SNOW)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold for: -$1,155.92 loss (-17.56%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reason: excessive stock based compensation (41% of revenue), usage based model still needs to be proved, management sub-par + killed the stock price, not currently profitable, product is a glorified database?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etsy (ETSY)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold for: -$1,594.53 loss (-37.55%)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold for: +$176.36 gain (+14.65%)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DigitalOcean (DOCN)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold for: -$312.96 loss (-51.44%)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sofi Technologies (SOFI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold for: -$362.07 (-34.55%)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reason: price trades erratically, prefer to invest in other industries, lack of understanding how banks make money (unfamiliar with banking industry)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell where these companies go. Each investment you choose has an opportunity cost. If you invest in one stock, you can't invest in another. I sold these stocks because I needed the money, but also because I felt that I should consolidate my portfolio into fewer positions. I hope by selling off the worst performers, I will hold onto the stocks that give great returns in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Q2 2024 Earnings Report Reflections</title><link href="https://divbull.com/q2-2024-earnings-report-reflections.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-15T15:02:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-08-15T15:02:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2024-08-15:/q2-2024-earnings-report-reflections.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In July and August, I listened to 25 earnings calls and read 2 call transcripts for the quarter.

This is the best I've ever done in terms of covering the earnings reports for companies I own. At the moment 
I'm holding 38 stocks with 6 more companies yet to report for this quarter. Below, I have written some themes and 
patterns observed here to reflect on what I heard in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate Cuts Are Coming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard many variations of "rate cuts coming later this year" meaning good times are coming for a lot of companies.
Nerdwallet (NRDS) said their loans business will pick up once rate cuts happen. Solar companies like 
Enphase Energy (ENPH) said "lower rates will be a tailwind" on their earnings call.
The consensus says the first rate cut will be in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Currency Volatility Uncertainty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Coca-Cola (KO) earnings call, they mentioned the possiblity of 10% "currency headwinds". I heard similar rhetoric cited as a headwind on many of the calls. Apple (AAPL) guided to expect a "foreign exchange headwinds impact on YoY basis"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The State of the Consumer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, there is an interest in understanding the state of the consumer within the lens of the broader economy. 
How good or bad are they doing? Coca-Cola (KO) noted they are seeing a "resilient consumer".
Chipotle (CMG) said on their earnings call they are seeing a "pullback in spending" by the consumer.
In general, the narrative seems to be "the consumer is struggling", but the best companies seem to be 
unaffected or even thriving regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamers Are Turning Profitable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney (DIS) and Paramount (PARA) both reached streaming profitability on their respective platforms, 
Disney+ and Paramount+ in this quarter. Disney's three headed monster of Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN is now making money. 
It seems legacy media is figuring out how to run a streaming platform that makes money. Spotify (SPOT) also recorded 
its 3rd consecutive quarter of profitability in the audio streaming world. Fubo (FUBO) is the other streamer 
I follow which is not currently profitable but is giving promising guidance for the future by raising revenue and subscriber guidance. FUBO won an injunction in court against VENU, the new sports streaming joint venture from Disney and Warner Bros. They're guiding to be profitable sometime in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food &amp;amp; Beverage Fading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Pinterest (PINS) call, they noted "broader headwinds" for their food &amp;amp; beverage customers. In general, restaurant brands and beverage companies are seeing a slowdown in business. Who knows how long this will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China Growth is at a Premium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a period of relative prosperity for American companies operating in China, it seems the growth has stalled 
or at least slowed down. This quarter, Apple's China sales were down 6% (3% currency related). They did celebrate 
a record high Chinese install base for the quarter. Crocs (CROX) is showing impressive growth with 70% sales growth
in China. Tesla (TSLA) China growth has declined with the overall auto industry lull in recent years. It has good 
relationships in China for its robotaxi operations to flourish, but when? Lately, the Chinese seem to be opting in 
favor of products from Chinese companies. Companies with superior products will win in China but not everyone will 
be able to compete with Chinese counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buybacks are Boomin'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of companies I own are aggressively buying back their own stock through share repurchases. It seems to be buybacks season for some reason. Here are a few that I noted: Paypal (PYPL), Alibaba (BABA), Apple (AAPL), Block (SQ), Crocs (CROX) and Enphase Energy (ENPH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Times in the Auto Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all automakers have experienced a rough 2024. The ones that are doing well have capitalized by selling hybrid vehicles.
The earnings reactions for almost all of them that I follow were negative after they reported:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ford,    F    -12%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toyota, TM    - 6%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla,  TSLA  -12%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rivian, RIVN  - 5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Elon once tweeted, it's hard to turn profits in the auto business. This is another sector that seemingly should benefit with rate cuts because it makes the loan to buy a car cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marijuana Stocks Will Benefit from Relaxed Government Regulation in the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new as murmurs of descheduling marijuana have floated around for years and state legislation change is ongoing. But this time it might be different. On their earnings call, Cresco Labs (CRLBF) said polls show support for schedule III drug reclassification. They are watching as adult use legislation hits the ballot in Florida in November, a crucial state with lots of potential. No one knows when the federal reclassification will hit the US. Cresco said on its recent earnings call, "Reform is imminent and we are ready." &lt;/p&gt;

You might, in your own bubble, conclude a stock will change the world. Based off your own experience loving the product, you buy the stock. Sometimes this approach can work, but it is no silver bullet. In this post, I'll consider 2 examples of unique value adding products that did actually translate into rising share price, Spotify (SPOT) and Crocs (CROX).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned many times how easy it is to overpay for a stock. If you blindly buy a stock because you are a customer, you can get burned buying at excessive valuation multiples or buying right before the business hits a down cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best companies warrant buying at high multiples, but it's an elite group. As we saw with the recent Crowdstrike fiasco, a company's reach is a double-edged sword that can be self-inflictive. Risk is always present in stocks. With that said, let's move on to cases where this did work out... so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2012, I used Spotify happily. In 2020, applying this product --&amp;gt; stock logic, I bought my first SPOT shares at $158. I voluntarily pay each month to have a full library of songs on my phone. Why not own this company? I got in and watched it soar in 2020 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021 the stock price ballooned and I bought 2 more shares at $320. Then 2022 arrived and SPOT fell under $100. Seeing a DCA opportunity in fall 2022, I scooped more shares around $75-$100, doubling down on my position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, Spotify has shown they are the real deal. Monthly active users continue to grow. Revenue was up 20% in Q1 2024. A savvy shift into podcasts has made the product even more compelling. Shares are back over $300. The company reached profitability in Q3 2023 for the 1st time in a year. Spotify is flexing its pricing power by raising subscription prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SPOT Chart After Earnings Report" src="https://divbull.com/images/SPOT-post-2024-Q2-earnings.png"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;SPOT Surges After Reporting Earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=SPOT-stock&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is starting to notice what Spotify is building. After today's earnings report the stock jumped 12%. They're striking the right chords with Wall Street and delivering consistent growth. They look more and more like a strong business who will be flowing cash for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CROX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CROX shoes stand out. They're comfortable, versatile and as funky as you want them to be. They're taking the world by storm. But how profitable could a shoemaker be? One thing that sets CROX apart is that most of its shoes are variations from the same core design. That seemingly boosts their profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I've never tried Crocs myself, I see them everywhere I go. They are a phenomenon that many people don't want to acknowledge. Most of my life, they were an afterthought. I often remarked in the past how polarizing they were amongst the people I knew. Either you wore Crocs or you saw them as hideous, with very few in between. It turns out there are enough of the former to keep Crocs growing profitably for the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Crocs Website" src="https://divbull.com/images/Crocs-shoes.png"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;Crocs Shoes, &lt;a href="https://careers.crocs.com/&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Crocs Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing the stock dip under $90 in fall 2023, I decided to roll the dice on it. I bought more from $100-$140. It's up 40% year to date. Now, it's my 7th largest stock position. Some might prefer to invest elsewhere than shoes. Q1 2024 net income was $792.6 million compared to $540.2 million in 2022. 32 million pairs of Crocs were sold in Q1 2024, up 3% YoY. I believe this is an extraordinary shoe product with compounding and growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One pleasant surprise has been their management. They are locked in and performing well after following the company the past year. They sold 119.6 million pairs of shoes worldwide for the Crocs Brand. This is a great product that seems to have half the Earth hooked, and the other half disgusted. Crocs acquiring HEYDUDE left an overhang that should lift with the strength of another established brand finding its footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product success does not equal stock success. However, it gives me more conviction to see the product frequently when out in the world. If you are experiencing the value of the product first hand, it's valuable to see how it performs its function in the real world. This product guided perspective of stock picking has worked sometimes in my experience. However, beware of your own echo chamber. It's easy to overestimate the value delivered and its future value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My HSA and IRA providers both listed all …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you find gainful employment, any employer worth a damn will offer benefits like a retirement 401(k), IRA plan or Health Savings Account (HSA). This is a reflection of how I made some smart moves with 2 previously dormant savings funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My HSA and IRA providers both listed all of the 20 or so funds to choose from with their plan fee rates. Every plan administrator will make a variety of funds accessible to you. There's usually options like a growth fund, total market fund, bonds fund, an international fund or small caps fund with more expensive fees. The cheapest option is usually a fund that tracks the S&amp;amp;P 500. In my case, my HSA S&amp;amp;P fund fee is 0.04% and the IRA S&amp;amp;P fund fee is 0.03%. Buying the S&amp;amp;P 500 was the cheapest in my case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to diversify your market exposure and gain better returns, it is tempting to try some of the other market or growth funds. However, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is more or less a lock to be a good investment. I'm buying as much of it as I can. In retrospect, I should have allocated more to the S&amp;amp;P index and less to individual stocks. Hindsight is 20/20. This month, I've essentially tripled down on the S&amp;amp;P 500. With my two retirement accounts now allocated to S&amp;amp;P 500 funds, I successfully bumped up my investment portfolio allocation from 2% to 7% in S&amp;amp;P 500 funds. Now I feel sufficiently exposed to the index. Who knows what that will grow to in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="S&amp;amp;P 500 Past 5 Years Chart" src="https://divbull.com/images/SP-500-5YR.png"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;S&amp;amp;P 500 Price From 2019-2024, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inx+500&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contributed to an HSA in my most recent job. My HSA provider was bought out, requiring a transfer to a new provider. After waiting for 6 months, I could finally invest my HSA funds after they were locked up in the transition from the old provider. I scanned the options to deploy this block of savings, noticing a fund named "Vanguard 500 Admiral Shares". This is a Vanguard S&amp;amp;P 500 fund, ticker &lt;a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vfiax#price"&gt;VFIAX&lt;/a&gt;. I set the allocation to 100% and can now forget it for the next 20 years. One quirk of my HSA is that I'm required to keep $1000 in cash for medical expenses, so technically it's not all in the market. I have a card I can use to pay for medical needs that draws from the cash in the account. It's nice to have this extra cash savings set aside for medical expenses!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my HSA settled into place, I turned my attention to a pesky IRA that eluded my understanding for far too long. I recently recovered the IRA from past employment I held 10+ years ago from my first job after college. I was not properly onboarded to the account from the onset and never really knew what was going on. To my surprise, I discovered it had been transferred from the previous bank that held the retirement fund to a new plan provider without any notice to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After calling the new provider, I finally gained online access to the IRA savings earlier this year. My savings had been auto-rolled to the new retirement plan provider and invested into a money market fund. Since being transferred, the IRA's account balance was slightly negative over 1.5 years in the money market fund after the provider fees being extracted from the account! The S&amp;amp;P 500 is up 36% over the same time period since Jan. 2023. I swiftly rebalanced the account to 100% allocation in Blackrock's &lt;a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/230317/blackrock-sp-500-stock-fund-class-k-fund"&gt;WFSPX iShares S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund&lt;/a&gt;, the only S&amp;amp;P 500 fund the new retirement plan provider offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.&amp;quot; - Unknown
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past year and a half was a missed opportunity for my IRA in hindsight. Not to mention the 8 years prior. It is a hard lesson to learn. I could have doubled that savings account had I invested it in the S&amp;amp;P 500 back in 2016. However, the important thing once you've realized a mistake is to correct course immediately and get the money invested. I want to let it grow with time by taking some risk in stocks. The S&amp;amp;P has proven itself consistently to steadily appreciate in the long run, despite a drawdown happening 1 in every 5 or so years. In 2024, it is up 18% year to date at the halfway point. It could and probably will retrace at some point. If you're a long term investor, the S&amp;amp;P is a stable bet, but not without some risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, you may want to roll your IRA into your own custody. It's not possible currently with my HSA. I plan to do this for the IRA but in the short to medium term, it's now deployed into the S&amp;amp;P 500. Common sense investing for the win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not sure how your retirement money is being deployed, call the plan provider and gain control of your online account. Find out where your money is being put to work. When you've held multiple jobs, it's easy to let a retirement account fall to the wayside. I missed out on some easy market gains over the past year and a half because of this. Learn from my mistakes. Keep a good watch of your employment retirement savings and make sure they are working for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Three Examples of Hedge Trades That Can Balance Your Portfolio</title><link href="https://divbull.com/three-examples-of-hedge-trades-that-can-balance-your-portfolio.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-25T04:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-05-25T04:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2024-05-25:/three-examples-of-hedge-trades-that-can-balance-your-portfolio.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Here are some examples of hedge pair trades that I've taken in my portfolio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Nvidia vs. Emerging Semiconductors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now the most common argument against buying Nvidia stock is that they may not be able to maintain their 95% market share only forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm holding an Nvidia long position but realized when I buy other semiconductors it's a hedge against their dominant position eroding over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top 10 holdings of the &lt;a href="https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239705/ishares-phlx-semiconductor-etf"&gt;SOXX Semiconductor ETF&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;NVDA NVIDIA Corporation (9.74%)
AVGO Broadcom Inc. (7.95%)
QCOM QUALCOMM Incorporated (7.41%)
AMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (6.18%)
MU Micron Technology, Inc. (5.18%)
ADI Analog Devices, Inc. (4.54%)
TXN Texas Instruments Incorporated (4.38%)
MCHP Microchip Technology Incorporated (4.33%)
TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (4.17%)
KLAC Kla Corp (4.16%)

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable holdings include Intel, Marvell, Lam Research and a basket of 30+ semiconductor related companies. If you're bullish on semiconductors, why not play the field? You're still buying Nvidia, but spreading your bet amongst a bunch of promising companies. If you believe a rising tide lifts all boats and there will be many winners in our AI future... why not own some Nvidia and something like the SOXX ETF?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Tesla + EVs + China Automakers (Future Automobiles) Vs. Toyota + Ford (Legacy Automobiles)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla boomed in the early 2020s by riding the EV wave and a low interest rate environment to payday. However, now the reality of 2024 is setting in for the electric vehicle market. Our EV future is somewhat postponed at the moment, or maybe it will take longer than we thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where we are in the EV timeline depends on where you live. Countries like Ethiopia are &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/02/it-begins-ethiopia-set-to-become-first-country-to-ban-internal-combustion-cars/"&gt;preventing the import of internal combustion engines&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, the EV future is progressing faster than anywhere else in the world. China automakers are showing a new wave of affordable,
tech forward electric vehicles are possible. Tesla is not the only one who can win at electric vehicles anymore. The rest of the world's automakers know a sleeping giant looms with Chinese automakers. Companies like BYD, Xpeng, Li Auto and Nio will play a significant role in the world's automotive landscape of the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid vehicles have emerged as the most sought after type of vehicle after Tesla rode the EV boom into 2021. Toyota is notably the biggest winner in the resurgence of hybrids and the purest play to fade our electric vehicle future. Toyota has been vocal in their opposition against the feasibility of electric vehicles. Ford is also losing money on its electric vehicle program but has remained committed to a profitable electric vehicle in the future, so they are less of a direct play against Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding both Tesla and legacy auto is a way to play both sides of the transition to electric vehicles. If consumer tastes move towards hybrids in the short term, Tesla will have a tougher environment to sell cars and Toyota will reap rewards from selling more hybrids. If electric vehicles gain traction quicker than expected, fade legacy auto if they fail to adapt to what kind of car people want to buy in the future. According to Llama 3 AI, we have an estimated 50-60 years of gasoline fossil fuels left on the planet. Someday, we'll need EVs and it won't be a choice. Who knows when that will actually happen. Play both sides of the trade by holding Tesla or Chinese electric vehicle makers against legacy automakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Bitcoin vs. Ethereum + Alt-Coins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin was the first mover in the crypto world. Ethereum has solidified as #2 in the crypto space. Most likely both will be important in cryptocurrency's future, but you could see better returns in some alt-coins in the short term. Crypto has a feel like there will be "many winners" in the long run, but who knows how many and for which use cases. Or maybe it will be like big tech, with only an oligarchy of coins reaching elite status. It's too early to tell how this space will shake out in the long run, so I'm holding some smaller cap coins along with a heavy weighting of the blue-chip coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to identify when an industry has "many winners" versus possibly only a few elite companies that emerge in the long run. It's possible to have the right industry, but not the right execution by the company you own. We can mitigate risk by making trades that hedge each other. This might limit gains on a higher conviction play, but it also caps your losses if the play doesn't pan out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Plausible Reasons to Take a Loss on a Stock</title><link href="https://divbull.com/plausible-reasons-to-take-a-loss-on-a-stock.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-20T04:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2024-04-20T04:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2024-04-20:/plausible-reasons-to-take-a-loss-on-a-stock.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am an advocate for long term buy and hold investing.

However, this post will play devil's advocate from my normal stance. Most times, we should wait for our investments to recover their value before selling. Here are some reasons that can justify selling out for less than you invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Feel Like You Overpaid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market tends to swing from bull to bear in a span of weeks or days. Sometimes the market collectively peaks and then drops off big. If you buy the top of a stock and then it deflates, there's no guarantee you'll ever recover your losses. For example in 2020, I bought 5 shares of PayPal at $196. Currently the price sits at $62 and I'm down 68% on those first 5 shares. The difference in the price I entered the position and the current price is a wide margin. I have dollar cost averaged down, now holding 25 shares and will break even at $91. But the buy on the 1st 5 shares will likely be under water for a long time. In this case, I sold two of the original 5 shares at a loss last year. By doing this, I'm mitigating risk and converting a bad buy into tax loss credits. Now, if I was more bullish I'd hold. PayPal has underwhelmed in recent years and the stock has a lot of bad juju. Not to mention, the payments space is very crowded with Apple Pay and Google Pay possibly set to poach PayPal's business. So I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. However, after its 3 year slump, maybe it will make a comeback. I felt like I overpaid when I opened the position, so this is an example where I divested some by taking a loss on some of the shares I bought for 3x the current market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking Losses Off the Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you buy a stock and it goes underwater, those buys will weigh down your portfolio's returns. By selling at a loss, you're taking that loss off your books and using it to lower your taxable income. Divesting limits your exposure if it never recovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Cutting the Fat"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common phrase you hear when people talk about investing and managing their portfolio. The "fat" is your bad positions. By removing it, you leave the leaner, quality "meat", aka the stocks that actually perform well. In a sense, this is a good habit to apply to your portfolio in order to rebalance and mitigate risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Businesses That Fail to Execute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone talks about fundamentals in investing. When investors talk about fundamentals, it basically means, is the business executing? Are they making money and executing their strategy? Yeti is an example of a business with a strong brand in drinkware and outdoor coolers that has lacked in execution recently. In 2023, they had to recall a soft cooler product, one of their top selling lines of business. The company has not sparked much excitement, despite their new partnership to sell in Tractor Supply Company stores. They could turn it around, but after opening the position in 2021 and adding over the past few years I chose to divest part of the position at breakeven. So I didn't take a loss in this case, but after reading their earnings call transcripts and reports in 2023, I decided that there are better opportunities than this company. I haven't sold out completely but I would consider selling at a loss if Yeti's woes continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Your Weakest Holdings Instead of Your Winners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to sell, &lt;a href="https://divbull.com/why-is-it-hard-to-let-your-winners-run"&gt;let your winners run&lt;/a&gt;. If life requires that you sell stocks for money, selling your worst performing stocks is more justifiable than selling your best performers in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the Size of a Bet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a little money off the table is a way to manage your risk and exposure to the turbulence of stocks. This is more applicable to taking profits in my opinion. Selling at a loss is another way to achieve reducing the amount of your free cash you have invested in any single stock. If it's not working, I'm more likely to take a small chunk of the position elsewhere, either at breakeven or taking a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Opportunities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are in the red on a stock, it might be a better move to sell out half or all of the position. Then you can take that cash and rotate it into a stock that has better fundamentals and momentum. This is somewhat risky but is a way that you can shift an underperforming stock into a stock that has a better chance of making actual returns on equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy and hold for a long time should be the default setting for most investors. Most times, we should &lt;a href="https://divbull.com/the-waiting-game"&gt;do nothing&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, it's not always the right move. On rare occasions, we should cut our losses and run to a better stock.&lt;/p&gt;

In a nutshell, the idea is hang on to your best stocks and sell the bad ones if you need to sell something. Of course, it's not so cut and dried. How do you know which ones are the good stocks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, at what point do you harvest gains on an investment? The hang-up is that you could sell a stock too early. This is a solid reason for long term investing, holding a stock for many years, regardless of what the price of the asset is. In theory, this should be easy. Just hold onto your shares. In practice, it's much more difficult to let your winners keep winning. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need money to live or pay for things. A lot of times, stocks are a source of money that provides a means to an end. I can't fault anyone who sells for this reason, I've done it many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversification is another valid reason to take profits. When a stock increases in value more rapidly than the rest of your portfolio, it begins to have an outsized impact on its trajectory. However, be cautious of selling too early in the name of reducing risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conviction to hold a stock comes from the prospects of the business it represents to make money. The stability of a business can fluctuate wildly in a chaotic world. If for some reason you lost your conviction to hold a company, I understand that as well. Investing is not "forever", it's only as long as you believe the company has positive cash flow and will continue to reap profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times a stock can shoot up in a short period of time, and then it's flat or negative for years at a time. It's impossible to know when a stock is about to run. In those years of consolidation, it's easy to look at the hot stock of the moment that's blowing up. It's easy to start thinking, "Why am I holding stock A when stock B is about to take off?" So you rotate into stock B just in time for its period of consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price can also become disconnected from the fundamentals of a business. It's easy to start second-guessing what could happen to a stock's price if a black swan event were to hit its industry. Nvidia comes to mind as a company whose stock price rocketed up so fast above $400, that many people started screaming sell. Time will tell if it was too early to sell Nvidia. Currently the price hovers around $900/share, and some people are still selling because the price went up. The price of an asset rising is not always a good reason to sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, humans are wired to appreciate making money but to fear with more intensity losing what we've gained. This can cloud our vision. When we start thinking about preserving our unrealized gains, we're no longer investing in a sense. In that moment, we are more like a trader speculating on short-term price movements. This is why, in my opinion, it's so hard to let your winners run. We want to preserve our wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to shed our instinctual preservation tendencies in order to really win big in the stock market. Most of the time, you need play the game for 10, 20 or 30 years to win at stocks. Hold for a long time and ignore your fears of losing your wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is often said of stocks, "no one ever went broke taking a profit." My response is: no one ever made it big selling early. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Finance also has the ability to fetch crypto prices for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, these prices seemed to update less reliably than stocks. I then found the IMPORTDATA() function, which updates crypto prices more reliably in my experience. The website cryptoprices.cc has made the prices available via their website and this function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Import Bitcoin's Crypto Price to Google Sheets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating Market Value, Profit and Return on Equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the prices of your assets auto-updating in Google Sheets, you can calculate the market value of your holdings by multiplying the price by the number of units, shares or coins you hold of an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Price x Quantity = Market Value)
=GOOGLEFINANCE(&amp;quot;NASDAQ:MSFT&amp;quot;) * {# Shares} = Market Value
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your Market Value of your holding, you can subtract the cost basis to see your total profit or gain/loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Market Value - Cost Basis = Profit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you calculate the profit, you can calculate the return on equity %:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Profit / Cost Basis = ROE %
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now tracking all my stocks, crypto and index funds in a single Google sheet with these functions. The prices tend to update at minimum every hour, but usually quicker. I'm impressed that Google has this functionality built-in, it's very useful!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Earnings Report Catalysts</title><link href="https://divbull.com/earnings-report-catalysts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-02-13T02:25:00-06:00</published><updated>2024-02-13T02:25:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2024-02-13:/earnings-report-catalysts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Predicting the way a stock will move on earnings is a dark art.

It can be frustrating because a company turns in a clean report, only to have the stock dump after they report. So what drives a stock to move on earnings?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To borrow a line from the movie "My Cousin Vinny", an earnings report is like a house of cards, built by management to communicate how they are a healthy, functioning business. There are several metrics on which the company must perform well, or the house (stock price) might collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Aggressive Revenue Growth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a company grows its quarterly revenue up unexpectedly, it gets investors' attention. A recent example is Nvidia, which was beating on all metrics to fuel its post earnings report runs. However, its impressive revenue growth grabbed headlines and stoked the excitement around its earnings. Another common metric to monitor is a stock's "average revenue per user" or ARPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Earnings Per Share Beat&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share is one of the most common metrics that gets scrutinized, hand in hand with revenue. It is a cornerstone of the "house" built by management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reinvesting to Grow Future Profits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's bullish when a company announces investments in itself to set up for future growth. For example, while Toyota is dominating the hybrid vehicle market, they're making plans for the future by building factories to address the electric vehicle market. By diversifying into different segments, they're setting up for more growth in the future. A loosely related metric is CAGR, or compound annual growth rate tracks a company's ability to compound growth. A company that reinvests in itself will likely have a stronger CAGR, which investors love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Impressive Free Cash Flow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors love to talk about a company's free cash flow. This is how much cash a business has after accounting for operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. This is the cash leftover that a business can use for dividends, paying debt or reinvesting in the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Declaring a Dividend&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a company declares a dividend unexpectedly or has an ongoing reputation as a "dividend aristocrat" they tend to hold more favor with investors. However, be aware of the trade-off the business is making between dividends and reinvesting the money in the business itself. Ultimately, the purpose of any business is to return value to shareholders and this is one way to explicitly achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock Buybacks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, stock buybacks are another way to return value to shareholders. A large stock buyback can appease investors because it is capital the company allocates directly to raising the stock price. This is money the company could be using elsewhere but it is common practice to buy back your own stock occasionally to return value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Growing Sales Rapidly&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profits of most companies can be traced back to its ability to sell its products. Sales is another metric that investors keep an eye on to see the health of the business. When sales are exploding, so does the stock price. However, sales are only a piece of the house. Growing sales is less impressive if the COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is offsetting those gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Profit Margin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla is an example of a company that has emphasis on its margin on each car it sells. The higher margin they can achieve on each vehicle produced, the more money they're making per car. Higher profit margin means more profit for the company's output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Profitable Business&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bull market, investors have a higher risk appetite for companies that are unprofitable. Spotify is an example of a company teetering on the edge of profitability. In Q3 2023, they reported a profitable quarter for the first time in a year. After earnings, the stock ran up +10%. It's looking promising for them to reach profitability but there is more risk waiting for that to happen than to own a business that's already profitable. However, if you get in before a business turns profitable and they succeed, you'll reap more gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Partnerships&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney recently announced an unexpected partnership with Epic Games. They are investing $1.5 billion for a stake in Epic. It could be a source of growth down the road that is not yet baked into the stock price. Epic has Fortnite, the most popular video game in recent years and a strong community behind it that could spur growth for Disney. Likewise, Microsoft gained extra wind in its sails due to its partnership investing $10 billion in OpenAI. On top of that, they can integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into their product suite and Bing search engine. This shows how strategic partnerships can give a company a shot in the arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forward Guidance Raised for Key Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidance can sway the sentiment of investors. Beating the guidance for earnings per share and revenue is generally seen as positive. The context of the guidance from the company management is important. Did they give soft guidance becuase of unseen supply chain issues or macroeconomic conditions? If so, beating the guidance means less. When the guidance is strong and the company "beats and raises" guidance, it's bullish for a stock. Giving soft guidance in order to smash future reports is also known as "sandbagging". You need to be vigilant to make sure the company you own is not sandbagging its guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Industry Key Performance Indicator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Q3 2023, Google turned in a seemingly solid report. However, the stock went -10% after earnings. Why? From reading sentiment online, the stock went down because the company missed their guidance on cloud growth. The cloud growth metric has an outsized impact on Google's earnings. In that quarter, they were penalized for missing. For social media or gaming platforms, monthly active users (MAUs) have outsized importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Management Shake-up&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This catalyst can be positive or negative, depending on the perceived state of the current management. Positions like the CEO, Chief Executive Officer, have outsized importance in the management of the company. If investors think the CEO is valuable to the company, the news that they are stepping down can drive the stock down. Conversely, if a CEO is perceived as weak, bringing in a new CEO can be a positive catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Catalysts Already Priced Into the Stock&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, all the good news is priced in. Stocks with momentum tend to run up heading into an earnings report in anticipation. If the report underwhelms and doesn't show any new catalysts, the stock price may deflate after earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some luck and skill, the "houses" you own will have strong foundations that will sustain growing income for many years. These are some things to watch for when a company you own reports earnings. It is seemingly impossible to understand why a stock moons or tanks after earnings, good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

2. own assets that appreciate in value (real estate, land, bonds, fixed income or stocks)&lt;br /&gt;
3. become employed, trade your time for money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading your time for money is part of the human experience. Since the dawn of modern civilization, humans have collaborated in an economy of goods and services. The industries and technologies deployed have changed, but employment is still a trade of human time or assets
for money in the capitalist world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should be selective of when we trade our time. It is probably our most valuable asset, more valuable than large sums of money. A lot of money without time is less than some money with time to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employment is the application of your time resource. When searching for your next trade, taking more time to consider different options is worth it. We don't always have the luxury
to pass on a job offer. The best outcome is a job that fits you better, challenges you,
provides new opportunities, improves your skills and sets you up for success.
Be selective but as the saying goes, "don't let great get in the way of good".
Sometimes a mediocre or undesirable job can give you momentum, new contacts, short term cash flow,
skills or a resume booster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're getting paid well but not challenged by the work or demotivated and burnt out from it, is that a good trade? Is the job also draining a lot of your energy? With a job, extra stresses and baggage tend to pile up over time. Is the trade worth the mental strain of holding the job? There could be a better opportunity that accelerates you in the direction you want rather than stagnating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your labor is an exchange of your time for money or other resources.
You have a set of skills and competencies to deliver outcomes to a company.
Your "career" is the trades you'll make with businesses or directly with
people over the course of your lifetime. Some trades will work out really well
and last many years. Others will only be shorter stints that merely set you up for
the next gig or keep you afloat for awhile. A good trade returns stability, opportunities, education and money at a lower cost to your hours worked and sanity. Make good trades and go smoothly in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>The Effect of Business Cyclicality on Stock Prices</title><link href="https://divbull.com/the-effect-of-business-cyclicality-on-stock-prices.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-30T04:20:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-30T04:20:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-10-30:/the-effect-of-business-cyclicality-on-stock-prices.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ask 10 people if a stock is a good investment.

You'll probably get some stories of why they wouldn't invest, past trades, losses, small gains or just indifference. Someone will probably be holding the stock if it's one of the popular blue chips. What you hear might also depend where the stock stands in the macroeconomic environment and how well they've been running the business lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you asked someone about Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) earlier this year, you'd probably hear
about their recent marketing fiascos which led to boycotts of their best-selling beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you asked a shareholder about Tesla (TSLA) last year, they'd probably have mentioned Elon Musk is selling shares to buy Twitter. If they did their research, they'd know in 2022 that Tesla was crushing its vehicle delivery targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the story around Netflix (NFLX) shifted. They reported a decrease in subscribers
in their quarterly results for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook dba Meta (META) was bloated with costs a year ago and the stock price showed the pain. The company overextended itself and had too many employees and diverging ambitions spreading it too thin. In times of perceived economic weakness, companies' ad budgets are often slashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a year later and most of these stocks are doing fine. In late 2022,
the prices of each of these companies contracted, due to market conditions but also based on their perceived strength in their ability to meet investors' expectations. Of course, the bear narratives were blasted across the internet. So what changed since then for these companies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta (META), lead by Mark Zuckerburg, successfully embraced cost cutting measures like
laying off employees and limiting investment in the Metaverse. In 2023 quarterly earnings reports, the bottom line showed better and leaner earnings. It bottomed below $100 in 2022. Wall Street bought the stock hand over fist after seeing the company's stronger earnings and renewed focus. Still kicking myself for not recognizing this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To combat its growth woes, Netflix introduced a new subscription tier with ads. In the following quarters, the stock price rebounded from under $200 and now sits above $400 after its most recent earnings report. I regrettably sold a few shares at a loss near the bottom.
However, the lesson learned is valuable. Companies will have bad quarters. They will miss expectations sometimes. If it's a good stock, it won't derail the overall narrative
around the company. In the end, I profited about $400 on my Netflix trade despite selling a few shares for a loss. But I could still be sitting on a few shares if I hadn't begun to doubt the growth narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anheuser-Busch is still trying to shake off its poor Marketing moves after a misguided campaign
that invoked negative political discourse. I don't think it changes the business fundamentals although the damage to its Bud Light beer brand seems irreparable. Or maybe people will move on eventually. Regardless, it hasn't moved the stock price. Maybe people will always reach for that light beer, who cares what kind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla has rebounded this year also from the overhang of Musk's Twitter purchase. This year, the stock is up 100% but it's not all roses. The company is now in the midst of a slowdown since buying a new car usually requires a loan. Thanks to the Fed and its ongoing assault against inflation, the monthly payments for new cars are much more expensive than 2-3 years ago.
Until macro conditions improve, it's going to be tough sledding for us investors.
The cycles of business worked in Tesla's favor up until 2022. Tesla has lowered the prices of its cars to increase its sales, a tactic that boosted demand in the past year. This is another example of the levers a company can pull to meet its goals. By changing prices, or extending their product offering a company controls its destiny. Tesla also is extending its product offering with the roll-out of Cybertruck. Deliveries are promised to begin next month, but Musk mentioned on the most recent earnings call it won't contribute to their bottom line meaningfully until 12-18 months down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed's interest rate increase is also weighing on my investments in solar energy, an industry which finds itself in a similar situation as Tesla's automotive loans. I believe
in the long term story for solar energy. In the short term, if someone wants to install a solar system on their roof or property, it's more expensive to take out the loan. Such is the cyclicality of business. From quarter to quarter, unexpected problems or geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions can surface that challenge a company's ability to hit its targets. As an investor, we need to clearly assess, "Given the recent turbulence, what are the implications for this stock's future success?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bad quarter won't sink a company. A few bad quarters won't either. A few bad years won't either, just look at Microsoft (MSFT) from 1999 to 2016. Its price bounced around $50 in this span. During this time it gained a reputation for being dead money to investors because it had done poorly for so long. However, Microsoft rapidly improved its ability to generate cash and innovated on its products. Today, it is one of the world's greatest tech companies. You would have a multi-bagger on your hands if you jumped into Microsoft 10 years ago when it was
left for dead by Wall Street. Wall Street's loss has now become my gain. Although I didn't get in until 2020, I am now happily long a bag of Microsoft shares with a broad knowledge of their business and hands on experience with many of their products. But even the strongest of companies will succumb to the inevitable up and down cycles of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past few years have been loaded with investing lessons. Don't get spooked out of an investment when a company reports a rough quarter or two. In the case of Netflix,
of course they changed their product offering to boost their subscribers after I sold.
The stock's price fundamentals were based on growth and they took measures to restore their subscriber growth to beat Wall Street's expectations. I never imagined they would roll out an ads-based subscription tier. This is an example where the short term speculation for a stock was based on outdated information. Netflix extended its product offering to boost
its subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the cost of borrowing money affects many goods and services. If a loan is required for someone to buy a company's product, it will thrive in times when money is cheap and stagnate when money becomes expensive. When the fed jacked up interest rates to 5-7%, they shifted the flow of money in the economy. They do this in the name of battling inflation. I wish I had learned this earlier. I had only seen the economy churning in a low interest rate environment for all of my adult life. I've been learning the hard way what an impact these rates can have on investing outcomes and business sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, cyclicality is not the enemy. It will influence the price of all stocks. Sometimes it will work in your favor. However, sometimes demand can be pulled forward due to external conditions and create "boom or bust" quarters. The pandemic is a perfect example. In 2020 and 2021, we enjoyed the boom times. The quarters since then have been tough on investors, but in general earnings reports seem to be improving. Some companies were doing record business during the pandemic, short-term phenomena. When it happens to be a good quarter, don't always assume the good times will continue rolling. When it goes the other direction, don't panic. It's easier said than done. Above all, trust your conviction. Read the signs for the company's long term health. If you don't have conviction to hold, that's your decision and one we all can understand. None of us know what will happen anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks trade on momentum and the market reacts to their earnings from quarter to quarter. A company that misses earnings estimates or key metrics will cause concern among investors. Sometimes there is simply nothing that can be done to avoid the cycles of business. My suggestion is to develop a thicker skin to hold on and clear thinking to assess if things are really going bad, or if it's just the cyclicality of the business and economy.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past, dividend stocks have held more favor with investors. I find it interesting that recently they've been cast as questionable investment for the long term investor. So what's wrong with getting a cash dividend back from your investments? The market seemed to be selling off these assets in the summer months of 2023. I think this is proof that all the critics come out of the woodwork when a stock's price is trending down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that when a company returns money to its owners, it's a last resort. The company is saying, "We have nothing better to do with this cash pile, so let's give it back it to our shareholders." It's a win-win situation, right? Kind of. Growth stock zealots are quick to point out that the money returned to the company's owners will deflate the stock price in the long run. I guess this is true. Instead of a dividend, a company can also choose to "buy back" its own stock instead, raising the price for shareholders without incurring any taxes. They could also invest in their business to increase future profits. Dividends are seen as characteristic of a business that is in its "declining corporation" phase, rather than its "wait until you see what we're going to do in the future" phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="life cycle of a business" src="https://divbull.com/images/business-life-cycle.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;source, Corporate Finance Institute: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/business-life-cycle/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, 22% of my savings is allocated into dividend-paying ETFs, mutual funds or stocks. According to Google Finance, my taxable portfolio and self-contributed IRA contain 8% medium dividend investments and 31% high P/E (price to earnings) investments. A stock's higher price to earnings ratio indicates it is trading at a multiple of its current earnings and is more likely associated with traditional growth stocks. You have to pay a higher multiple to gain the income streams of these high P/E businesses. I want to invest more into dividend stocks to raise my passive income level. Currently I earn around $50/month from my investments. Most of this is automatically reinvested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get to choose if you want to reinvest your dividends or take them as cash in your pocket. If you take it in cash, you'll need to pay a tax. If you use it to buy more shares automatically, you'll still need to pay a tax. So either way, part of your dividends are going to the government. If you hold foreign assets that pay dividends, the tax gets taken out of your payment before you receive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all dividends are the same. Yahoo Finance is great for researching dividend yields. It lists the forward dividend &amp;amp; yield of every stock if it pays a dividend. For example, Ford (4.98% yield) and Coca-Cola (3.40%) each yield a larger dividend so I've been scooping up shares. I believe these businesses are rock solid. Thanks to the dividend stock summer sale, they have pulled back from their all-time highs. I'm betting they will still be thriving 30 years from now. Hopefully, their yield will boost my passive income along the way if needed. I like having the option to turn off drip investing and flip them to cash if I need some extra money. Their prices also tend to be more stable. Whereas a growth stock needs to continue its trajectory of growth in order to justify its price to earnings multiples. If the economy slows down, they might suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3-6% dividend yield is seen as a "goldlocks zone" of dividends. Anything higher than that might be a "value trap", luring in yield chasers to a owning a business with questionable fundamentals. If you are paid a whopping dividend but the price of your shares is decreasing, it offsets your returns. It may not be the best move to invest, despite reaping these giant yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age is a factor to consider how much you want to commit to dividend versus growth stocks. I'm 33 years old, so I likely have an easy 20-30 years before I'd want to use my invested money, barring emergencies or large purchases where I need to raise cash. If you're younger, the growth stock enthusiasts say you should be more oriented for long term growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the concept of a hybrid "dividend growth" stock. Microsoft (0.90%), Apple (0.54%) and Nvidia (0.04%) are examples of companies with higher P/E ratios that are rapidly growing their business and pay a smaller dividend than Coke or Ford. These types of companies are a happy medium between dividend and growth in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I propose that a mix of dividend and growth stocks is the best approach to investing. Like most things in life, it's not all-or-nothing. Your allocation depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, salary and age. If your salary is comfortable, you may not need to worry about passive income and can re-invest your cash payouts. If you're unemployed, you can use dividends to spell your expenses. Later in life, you might be lucky enough to live off your dividends. I hope to get there someday!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>The Waiting Game</title><link href="https://divbull.com/the-waiting-game.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-09T15:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-09T15:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-10-09:/the-waiting-game.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of investing is not doing anything at all.

You need to wait for your investments to compound over time. The problem is the narratives that surround your investments. Adding more uncertainty, unexpected "black swan" events like wars and COVID can scare investors into thinking they know what's going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not against actively managing your portfolio. Sometimes, we need to consider new information that changes our theory for why something will be a solid investment. For example, if a company is hemorrhaging money and not showing any signs they will turn it around. But there's still a chance they might figure it out some years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a gray area of investing where risk meets reward. You can choose to stick with an underperformer. If the company eventually dominates their sector and takes market share, leading to profits then you'll be rewarded. More risk, more reward. I personally like to include a few speculative plays in my portfolio, but honestly it doesn't ease your nerves to watch a company you own struggle to reach profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most profitable investment that I'm still holding, Tesla, falls into this category. I thought the world was destined to have an electric vehicle future before many saw the writing on the wall. Before the company turned profitable, I bought a bag of shares with intent to hold for a long time. Luckily, they turned their first annual profit in 2020 and continue to improve their results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the EV theory has paid well and the electric vehicle movement shows no signs of stopping. This story is an example of how you can invest on what you think the world will look like in the future, even if the situation is questionable in the present moment. Just know that it might take longer than you think to play out, or you could be wrong and it never plays out. The friction of this uncertainty in the outcome is what makes investing hard. Sometimes, there are simply better options to reallocate your losses into another more promising company that already has established a sound balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that many times, but not always, the best action is not to make any moves. You've got a large unrealized loss, but how do you know that market volatility won't swing the other way on your position? If you believe the company will be important in the future, hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is tough because it's easy to be convinced by a stranger or talking head online that they know what's going to happen. More often than not, it's best to play the waiting game. Extend your holding period and the likelihood you'll profit increases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Make Small Bets</title><link href="https://divbull.com/make-small-bets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-09T20:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-09T20:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-08-09:/make-small-bets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Small bets can have outsized returns.

If it goes south, you've also got less on the line. Have conviction? Make a larger bet. Not sure about an investment? That's a solid candidate for a small bet. You find out the company's outlook is now questionable or management is not meeting the mark? You could always sell half. However, the largest gains come from letting asset value compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of your bankroll determines your range. Consider making some small bets in stocks, real estate or even starting a business.
There is less stress in a small bet. For me, it's $50-$500 up to $1,000 that I consider a "small bet" in my taxable investor brokerage account. Anything greater than that and it's no longer a "small bet" to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even have some $50 or $100 positions that I might add to someday. This is the magic of stocks. Value tends to go up over time. You could have bought almost any stock at the end of 2022 and would riding gains. At the time, no one knew what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the general outlook for stocks seems favorable, with consensus that the recession is cancelled. Year to date, the market is mostly reacting in a way that suggests we were in the "oversold" range at the end of last year. Are we now overbought? I doubt it, but we'll see! My theory is that now is a still a decent time to open some small bets to gain exposure to exceptional asset value growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My portfolio is tech heavy with some strategic industries like electric vehicles, solar energy and cloud computing. I also reaped some of the sudden 2023 AI buzz in Tesla, Microsoft and Nvidia with tech prices getting a lift pretty much across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is a core position in my portfolio. Nvidia was a medium sized bet that resulted in a 3x bagger gain. It's now a small bet again after I took some profits. Even on a small bet, booking 3x your money is a pleasant payday. After making the original bet in 2020, I'm letting my $1000 cost basis ride in this stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to encourage anyone to get into a high multiple valuation. I say that knowing this semiconductor company is a one of my best small bets currently. Risky or frothy prices might be right for a tiny bet with the possiblity of adding more later on a dip. Sometimes it pays to buy a company on such a trajectory but it honestly scares me to buy it now. So I'm holding my small Nvidia bet for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afterword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice nor all writing on this blog. Learn to assess the health of a business. It is an art based on valuation, cash flow, profits, management, margins, market share, strategy, reinvesting assets for compounding growth and so on. Investing is unpredictable and risky, sure, but make some small bets. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting Out of LYFT Stock</title><link href="https://divbull.com/getting-out-of-lyft-stock.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-13T12:36:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-13T12:36:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-05-13:/getting-out-of-lyft-stock.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm an advocate for "buy and hold" investing, meaning if you are making an investment it should be for a long period of time before selling.

However, you may need to cut a position due to a company's failure to turn a profit or dependency on bending public policies to their favor. This was the case with LYFT, based in California, the battleground of workers rights that shifted over the years as ridesharing went mainstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a game-changing service to society helping people get where they needed to go. I also moonlighted as a LYFT driver for a few months in 2017, seeing first-hand how they onboarded drivers. LYFT filed an IPO in March 2019. I had $2,600 to invest and wanted a piece of those huge ridesharing profits that were going to happen someday. In retrospect, this was too speculative of an investment. LYFT was growing riders, but profitability hadn't been proven yet. Being in my 20s, I was just starting to invest and eager to start buying stocks with the extra money I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid $65 per share for LYFT shortly after its IPO (Initial Public Offering) in 2019, under the IPO price of $72. Another lesson from this trade is that it more risky to buy an IPO close to its debut in public trading. But I couldn't resist so I put it on LYFT shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned from holding LYFT stock is to consider the risk of political impacts on your stocks. In the case of LYFT, they and UBER were typically involved in regulatory battles with the state of California over the classification of their drivers in the past 10 years. Are rideshare driver independent contractors? The debate continues. And each time it blew up on the news, I looked at those shares and thought... I signed up for this? Court battles. A questionable public image and an unprofitable business to boot. Having tried LYFT's rideshare services myself, I thought their culture was strong and they'd be a leader in a promising new industry. We'll see if they ever make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lyftstockprice" src="https://divbull.com/images/lyftstockprice.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They closed around $8 per share yesterday. My investment? Within the first year, I was already down considerably and endured several painful earnings reports. They were nearly profitable, but then were hit hard by pandemic lockdown. I sold out from 2021 to 2022, selling each share at a loss. 90% of the shares were sold in June to October 2021 near the end of the most recent bull market. Only with hindsight, can I now say I feel strongly it was the right call. If I had left the money there, I'd be sitting on $375 in market value in Lyft and over $2,000 of unrealized losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold the position incrementally, ranging from $38 - $63 per share. I sold my last 5 shares at $38 per share in Feb. 2022. Having cleared the position, I now know from experience, there are times when you should cut your losses. In total, I limited the damage to $546 lost and re-allocated the remaining $2K to other investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at LYFT in 2023, it's down 89% over the past 5 years, unprofitable with a real possibility of bankruptcy. Recently, the founders have stepped back from operating the company. They're also low-key saying they're open to a buyout. Maybe they will turn it around, but I'm no longer on the hook for a few grand if they don't. I now try to buy companies that have already established profitability and growing. This is my LYFT story, may we all stay away from such investments and realize quickly if we've miscalculated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Regression to the Sea</title><link href="https://divbull.com/regression-to-the-sea.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-11T21:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T21:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-05-11:/regression-to-the-sea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A market of stocks reminds me of a school of fish.

They swarm in the same general motion, sometimes using their collective to protect each individual fish with natural deception. Some of the fish are stonger than others, use their competitive advantage to survive and help the other fish. But if a fish becomes too weak, it gets eaten. Same with stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the stock market was bubbling up together in a cash injected, inflation-fueled blow-out. Then the direction of the tide shifted. After pulling back strongly into summer, a brief respite in July before getting hammered even more, with a possible bottom reached in late December. Warren Buffett once said, "Only when the tide goes out, do you learn who has been swimming naked." It's the weaker companies burning through cash struggling to survive. They get metaphorically eaten. Thankfully, stocks are starting to bounce back. It's now a "stock picker's market" or so I've heard. If you bought anything in December, you're probably up a decent amount on the investment. In a few cases, my new positions and DCA buys from within the past 6 months are up 80%. Of course, I'm still down 30%-60% or [gasp] more on too many positions. Regardless, I tend to buy and hold with an option to sell at breakeven if I don't like the company's power structure or earnings reports. I can wait a long time and intend to do so with all my stocks. Sidebar: did you know whales can live up to 90 years? They're probably good investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like fish, stocks valuations are loosely tied together, especially at an industry level. If prices go up a lot, they'll probably reverse eventually. If they recently pulled back hard, there is a better chance for growth at a reasonable price. Sometimes you have to load up when a stock is down over 20% in a single day. When all hope is lost, yet another regression but this time upwards after you bought it if you chose well. It's not always going to work out, but lowering your cost average is generally considered a good idea in investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, no one really knows what the market will do. The stock market's short-term direction is about as random as a school of fish. When the market regresses to the mean and sells off: buy the fish that is consistently makes the right moves. It has these characteristics: quickly acquires customers and keeps them, protects or grows their product profit margin, survives economic drawdowns, socially responsible and guides earnings appropriately. That's a catch!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>10 Ways I Keep Up With My Stocks</title><link href="https://divbull.com/10-ways-i-keep-up-with-my-stocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-22T14:09:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-04-22T14:09:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-04-22:/10-ways-i-keep-up-with-my-stocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post summarizes ways that I keep tabs on the companies I'm holding in my investment portfolio.

I tend to hold stocks for a long time, regardless of stock price movements. It helps to see the whole picture, industry, customer mentality and metrics like free cash flow and profits. These are ways I try to glean insights into a company's future potential or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are 10 ways I keep up with my stocks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Charles Schwab investor checking account to buy assets + make trades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch CNBC for free in the Charles Schwab mobile app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track dividends received in Charles Schwab account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance/"&gt;Google Finance&lt;/a&gt; to manage watchlists and monitor daily prices. Schwab also has a watchlist but I prefer Google Finance's UI for watching short term price movements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the company "in the wild".&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If public, visit the company and observe what you see. Is it a well run operation? Are customers happy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the frequency you see people choosing the company's products day to day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus points if you are the customer, you know intimately what value the company is creating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings calls: listen to the call live or most companies post the call transcript online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read investing blogs and books from the greats. I subscribe to my followed blogs via an RSS feed. Here are a few I recommend:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/"&gt;The Reformed Broker&lt;/a&gt;, Josh Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/"&gt;Of Dollars and Data&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Magiulli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benjamin Graham, Intelligent Investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor sentiment with Twitter and Reddit. Read the Twitter cashtags for individual stocks and browse social media for overall sentiment monitoring. Beware there are emotional posters with an agenda, opinion or position that may contradict yours. I find it useful for gaining a sense of general feelings about the market or shares in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use finance Python libraries, like &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/"&gt;yfinance&lt;/a&gt; to see more complex financial calculation about a stock. I wrote in depth about the endless tools you can apply for financial calculation &lt;a href="https://lofipython.com/pick-stocks-like-a-pro-with-ffn/"&gt;here on my other blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to people about their investments. What are they investing in? What's working for them? What are they excited about? They have a perspective that differs from yours that exposes you to a new concept or industry.&lt;/li&gt;

Since beginning in 2018 with approximately $15,000 in savings, I've accrued a six figure portfolio of funds and stocks with a "DCA and buy and hold" long term mentality. I did this by holding a full time job and earning multiple pay increases along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50% of my retirement funds are in a managed employer match 401(k) with a different bank. My primary bank is Charles Schwab. Most of my self-directed IRA is collecting dividends with Schwab index funds (SCHB, SWPPX and SWTSX) and MSFT. My self directed IRA has a smaller weight of non-dividend growth stocks also. In my taxable portfolio, the core dividend earners are stocks like MSFT, NKE, AAPL, F and NVDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 3-5% of my investment portfolio is committed to cryptocurrency assets. After buying incrementally from December 2020 to 2022, I now have market value exceeding $5,500 staked in Ethereum. Approximately 60% of my crypto portfolio is in ETH, followed by 25% Bitcoin, which does not have a staking protocol. Over the past 7 months, my staking rewards netted me $12.48 per month by my calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Investing Income Breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Stock Dividends:    $38/month&lt;br&gt;
Ethereum Staking:   $12.48/month&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, they add up to a investment income of $50/month and counting with time. Hold dividend stocks and index funds. Stake Ethereum, if you can handle elevated risk that surrounds crypto. Then again, with the recent banking shakeout, maybe a more decentralized store of value is intriguing. Find a job or start a business, keep saving and reap the rewards of investing. This is how I achieved a new level of passive income. In both, their dividends are automatically re-invested.&lt;/p&gt;

First, a disease is manufactured and propagated. Then, a response to the disease is conceived. It includes locking down society and subsidizing the people with printed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a tidy narrative for companies to retrofit to their own needs. A cycle of boom and bust is synthesized in the name of the greater good. Employers now have a reason to fire their employees and raise prices of their widgets. Stocks suffer because it's going to be difficult. Everyone knows a recession is coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear mounts. Worries pile up. The Federal Bank must curb inflation. They need to raise interest rates on borrowing money to get this nasty inflation monster under control. Now it costs more money for people to take out a loan and buy houses. Companies don't give raises. Inflation of consumer staples eat into our salaries. "The recession is coming!", they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summation, we have a (natural?) phenomena, seized by world governments to extend their power in the name of protecting the people. Stocks go down for now. That's ok as a long term investor. However, I can't get over the idea that is all humans, all the way down. Humans doing human things: scheming, reacting and seizing an opportunity to claim the sky is falling. All along, fat cats padding their own pockets at the expense of their fellow man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think a recession will happen? Is it already happening? Or is it only our reaction to the idea of it?

&lt;p&gt;Checking Investopedia, the top hit on Google, "There is no universal standard for calculating the intrinsic value of a company... Typically, investors try to use both qualitative and quantitative to measure the intrinsic value of a company, but investors should keep in mind that the result is still only an estimate." - Investopedia, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next hit, Corporate Finance Institute offers a "Net Present Value" based formula, along with net cash flow, interest rate, etc. So it seems that the mathematics of instrinsic value calculation are sound, but the weighting of possible future outcomes is where an an analyst is more of an artist.
https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/intrinsic-value-guide/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, intrinsic value is a mathematical model an analyst creates by weighing projected outcomes. There is no standard for producing an intrinsic valuation of a company. I find this somewhat amusing, because before when I heard the term intrinsic valuation, I  assumed there was more to it. Such as a formal methodology that is carried out. However, like all future prediction models, they are subjective and sound more like a guess to me. I will be sure to take these instrinsic value calculations with a grain of salt from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Industry-Based Investing</title><link href="https://divbull.com/industry-based-investing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-08-28:/industry-based-investing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When picking investments, I like the idea of selecting assets based on their industry or the rise of a specific technology.

For these reasons, I am marginally invested and building a position in a solar company, Sunrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles are another industry that I believe will play a big part in the future of humanity, so I'm holding Tesla. It's been my best investment by far. I'm still holding because I believe that electric vehicles are going to be huge in the future. One can hold a company based on principle, provided the quarterly earnings reports are acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your thesis will be wrong. You can't win 'em all. You also don't need to win them all. Pick a few winners and mix with index funds to round out your portfolio and the 80\20 rule will emerge. A few of your assets will perform better than the others and reap most of your gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this industry-based line of thinking is a way to frame your investments that can make it easy to remember why you're holding it. One can certainly be wrong about our projections into the future, but these are the types of angles a keen investor seeks out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Buy The Close</title><link href="https://divbull.com/buy-the-close.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-16:/buy-the-close.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my experience, markets sometimes open up with a pump in prices.

&lt;p&gt;I find it's best to watch stocks throughout the trading day, then put in a buy order in the final hours or minutes before the market closes for the day. This is general knowledge for most investors and traders. While not always a certainty, I think it is a good tip to keep in mind when adding to your portfolio on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;

Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can have broad-sweeping effects on all stocks and index funds regardless of company performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors like growing companies. In recessionary times, investors like profitable companies with stable product demand. Therefore, the companies that are less profitable now but investing heavily in the future may be undervalued currently compared to their potentially more developed, profitable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks like NET and SNOW are tech infrastructure plays that have been hit hard by the flight to more established companies. Their underlying bull theses are still in tact. Today, they are priced at a 50%-60% discount compared to their price at the beginning of 2022. The recent market turbulence is allowing me to lower my cost basis on both positions. In the long run, savvy investors will repurpose this downturn into an opportunity. I'm betting that will be the case with these two promising companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stocks will go down and it is not necessarily an indicator of weakness. Trust your convictions and consider tuning out the stop loss daytrader heros. Sure, it's fine to cut losses. However, sometimes it's necessary to hold your shares "in the red" until conditions improve. Your positions will recover faster if when stocks get cheaper, you buy more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Are We in the "Worst Case" Scenario?</title><link href="https://divbull.com/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-10T11:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-10T11:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-10:/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks are concerned, yes I think so.

Perhaps the inverse of selling is the answer. Why not wait 10 or 20 years and see where the market lies? You can also do nothing and build your cash pile, maybe a smart move in this environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not calling a bottom. Stock valuations are unpredictable and since the trend is down, prices might go lower. My bets are placed that we're nearing worst case scenario territory at the moment. Disease, war and inflation have given a much needed haircut to the frothy stock prices of 2021. Here's hoping to better scenarios ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Longview</title><link href="https://divbull.com/longview.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-09T10:44:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-09T10:44:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-09:/longview.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's hard to imagine what life could look like in 30 years.

One lesson of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is that predicting the markets is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A perspective beyond this current slot of time with assets steadily growing is possible. Index funds all but guarantee it. However, if you bought index funds at the beginning of 2022, you lost approximately 15%. Worst 1st half in the stock market since 1970! That's tough, but don't worry. In 10, 20, or 30 years all will be fine.

I just wasn't that interested in a subject that mostly flew over my head at age 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class consisted of watching video lectures from a reasonable, jolly Finance professor. I failed to absorb most of the lessons, grasping only enough to not get decimated by the course's mid-term and final exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lesson stood out from my professor, who seemed to know his field... "Buy and Hold". Nothing revolutionary but it was the first time someone had introduced me to this simple philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning and hanging onto a stock usually outperforms other more short-sighted investing or trading schemes. It stuck with me. While I have my share of bad investments, the philosophy holds weight and guided me towards some profitable ideas. I continue to hold my highest conviction securities and hold small positions if I am less sure about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid investment held on a 5, 10 or 30 year investment horizon will probably appreciate in value. Historically, this is true for many stocks. However, Graham knew investment returns may be extremely unpredictable in sure times and increasingly volatile with global tensions mounting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry></feed>
