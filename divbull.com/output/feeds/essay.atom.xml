Since beginning in 2019 with approximately $15,000 in savings, I've accrued a six figure portfolio of index funds and stocks with a "DCA and buy and hold" long term mentality. I achieved this by holding a full time job throughout the time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50% of my retirement funds are in a managed employer match 401(k) with a different bank. My primary bank is Charles Schwab. Most of my self-directed IRA is collecting dividends with Schwab index funds (SCHB, SWPPX and SWTSX) and MSFT. My self directed IRA has a smaller weight of non-dividend growth stocks also. In my taxable portfolio, the core dividend earners are stocks like MSFT, NKE, AAPL, F and NVDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 3-5% of my investment portfolio is committed to cryptocurrency. After buying incrementally from December 2020 to 2022, I now have a market value above $5,000 invested and staked in Ethereum. Approximately %60 of my crypto portfolio is in 
ETH, followed by %25 Bitcoin, which does not have a staking protocol. Over the past 7 months, my staking rewards netted me $12.48 per month by my calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passive Investing Income Breakdown
Stock Dividends     $38/month
Ethereum Staking    $12.48/month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are 2 ways I found to make passive income of $50/month and counting with time. Hold dividend stocks and index funds. Stake Ethereum, if you can handle elevated risk. Find a job or start a business, keep saving and reap the rewards of investing. This is how I achieved a new level of passive income.&lt;/p&gt;

If you still have conviction, the market's volatility has created a possible buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple put into words, but observing the market in real time never goes so smoothly. Your perceptions of a "bottom" or a stock's range can be way off. Volatility is an opportunistic investor's friend, and a timid or inexperienced investor's foe. However, even a seasoned pro can get it disastorously wrong and get wiped out by a falling knife. Make volatility your friend, but be careful!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Gains Happen in Bursts</title><link href="https://divbull.com/gains-happen-in-bursts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-14T11:22:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-14T11:22:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-12-14:/gains-happen-in-bursts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gains tend to happen quickly in a short time.

First, a disease is manufactured and propagated. Then, a response to the disease is conceived. It includes locking down society and subsidizing the people with printed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a tidy narrative for companies to retrofit to their own needs. A cycle of boom and bust is synthesized in the name of the greater good. Employers now have a reason to fire their employees and raise prices of their widgets. Stocks suffer because it's going to be difficult. Everyone knows a recession is coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear mounts. Worries pile up. The Federal Bank must curb inflation. They need to raise interest rates on borrowing money to get this nasty inflation monster under control. Now it costs more money for people to take out a loan and buy houses. Companies don't give raises. Inflation of consumer staples eat into our salaries. "The recession is coming!", they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summation, we have a (natural?) phenomena, seized by world governments to extend their power in the name of protecting the people. Stocks go down for now. That's ok as a long term investor. However, I can't get over the idea that is all humans, all the way down. Humans doing human things: scheming, reacting and seizing an opportunity to claim the sky is falling. All along, fat cats padding their own pockets at the expense of their fellow man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think a recession will happen? Is it already happening? Or is it only our reaction to the idea of it? I, for one, find it amusing how humans can be so sure they know what is coming and what has already happened. I'm a skeptic! This recession is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Check Your Expectations</title><link href="https://divbull.com/check-your-expectations.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-09-08T23:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-09-08T23:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-09-08:/check-your-expectations.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed Josh Brown's perspective as the market thrashed the past few years.

Intrinsic value is often praised as a claim to why the market price of company should be higher. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking Investopedia, the top hit on Google, "There is no universal standard for calculating the intrinsic value of a company... Typically, investors try to use both qualitative and quantitative to measure the intrinsic value of a company, but investors should keep in mind that the result is still only an estimate." - Investopedia, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next hit, Corporate Finance Institute offers a "Net Present Value" based formula, along with net cash flow, interest rate, etc. So it seems that the mathematics of instrinsic value calculation are sound, but the weighting of possible future outcomes is where an an analyst is more of an artist.
https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/intrinsic-value-guide/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, intrinsic value is a mathematical model an analyst creates by weighing projected outcomes. There is no standard for producing an intrinsic valuation of a company. I find this somewhat amusing, because before when I heard the term intrinsic valuation, I  assumed there was more to it. Such as a formal methodology that is carried out. However, like all future prediction models, they are subjective and sound more like a guess to me. I will be sure to take these instrinsic value calculations with a grain of salt from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Industry-Based Investing</title><link href="https://divbull.com/industry-based-investing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-08-28:/industry-based-investing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When picking investments, I like the idea of selecting assets based on their industry or the rise of a specific technology.

One can observe the world, watch trends come and go and consider adding them to your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I believe that solar technology is likely to be an important source of energy in the future. I am basing this thesis on an anecdotal conversation with an energy engineer, along with generally positive sentiment for the solar energy industry as of late. For these reasons, I am marginally invested and building a position in a solar company, Sunrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles are another industry that I believe will play a big part in the future of humanity, so I'm holding Tesla. It's been my best investment by far. I'm still holding because I believe that electric vehicles are going to be huge in the future. One can hold a company based on principle, provided the quarterly earnings reports are acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your thesis will be wrong. You can't win 'em all. You also don't need to win them all. Pick a few winners and mix with index funds to round out your portfolio and the 80\20 rule will emerge. A few of your assets will perform better than the others and reap most of your gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this industry-based line of thinking is a way to frame your investments that can make it easy to remember why you're holding it. One can certainly be wrong about our projections into the future, but these are the types of angles a keen investor seeks out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Buy The Close</title><link href="https://divbull.com/buy-the-close.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-16:/buy-the-close.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my experience, markets sometimes open up with a pump in prices.

Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can have broad-sweeping effects on all stocks and index funds regardless of company performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors like growing companies. In recessionary times, investors like profitable companies with stable product demand. Therefore, the companies that are less profitable now but investing heavily in the future may be undervalued currently compared to their potentially more developed, profitable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks like NET and SNOW are tech infrastructure plays that have been hit hard by the flight to more established companies. Their underlying bull theses are still in tact. Today, they are priced at a 50%-60% discount compared to their price at the beginning of 2022. The recent market turbulence is allowing me to lower my cost basis on both positions. In the long run, savvy investors will repurpose this downturn into an opportunity. I'm betting that will be the case with these two promising companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stocks will go down and it is not necessarily an indicator of weakness. Trust your convictions and consider tuning out the stop loss daytrader heros. Sure, it's fine to cut losses. However, sometimes it's necessary to hold your shares "in the red" until conditions improve. Your positions will recover faster if when stocks get cheaper, you buy more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Are We in the "Worst Case" Scenario?</title><link href="https://divbull.com/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-10T11:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-10T11:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-10:/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks are concerned, yes I think so.

&lt;p&gt;I'm not calling a bottom. Stock valuations are unpredictable and since the trend is down, prices might go lower.

&lt;p&gt;The class consisted of watching video lectures from a reasonable, jolly Finance professor. I failed to absorb most of the lessons, grasping only enough to not get decimated by the course's mid-term and final exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lesson stood out from my professor, who seemed to know his field... "Buy and Hold". Nothing revolutionary but it was the first time someone had introduced me to this simple philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning and hanging onto a stock usually outperforms other more short-sighted investing or trading schemes. It stuck with me. While I have my share of bad investments, the philosophy holds weight and guided me towards some profitable ideas. I continue to hold my highest conviction securities and hold small positions if I am less sure about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid investment held on a 5, 10 or 30 year investment horizon will probably appreciate in value. Historically, this is true for many stocks.
