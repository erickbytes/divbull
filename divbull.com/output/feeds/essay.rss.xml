First, a disease is manufactured and propagated. Then, a response to the disease is conceived. It includes locking down socienty and supplementing the people with printed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a tidy narrative for companies to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 13:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-10-08:/the-recession-is-bullshit.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Check Your Expectations</title><link>https://divbull.com/check-your-expectations.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed Josh Brown's perspective as the market thrashed the past few years. A CNBC regular with razor sharp takes, I think I heard him recently say something to the effect of "check your expectations".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with many things Josh says, but especially with this sentiment. Stoics know …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 23:42:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-09-08:/check-your-expectations.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>What Does Intrinsic Value Mean?</title><link>https://divbull.com/what-does-intrinsic-value-mean.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The goal of this post is to find a layman's idea of what a stock's "intrinsic value" means. Intrinsic value is often praised as a claim to why the market price of company should be higher. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking Investopedia, the top hit on Google, "There is no …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 12:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-09-02:/what-does-intrinsic-value-mean.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Industry-Based Investing</title><link>https://divbull.com/industry-based-investing.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When picking investments, I like the idea of selecting assets based on their industry or the rise of a specific technology. One can observe the world, watch trends come and go and consider adding them to your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I believe that solar technology is likely to be an …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 14:48:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-08-28:/industry-based-investing.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Buy The Close</title><link>https://divbull.com/buy-the-close.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In my experience, markets sometimes open up with a pump in prices. In situations where I bought near to the open because of some anticipated event, I usually bought at a higher price than if I had waited.&lt;/p&gt;

Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:23:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-07-11:/when-stocks-go-down.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Are We in the "Worst Case" Scenario?</title><link>https://divbull.com/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks are concerned, yes I think so. While the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index is down approximately 15% YTD, many stocks saw anywhere from 30-80% drawdowns. Now one would think selling does not make much sense. Perhaps the inverse of selling is the answer.

We short-sightedly see chaos in our world, and the markets start wavering. I won't tell you what to do now. One lesson of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is that predicting the markets is futile.&lt;/p&gt;

I just wasn't that interested in a subject that mostly flew over my head at age 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class consisted of watching video lectures from a reasonable, jolly Finance professor. I failed to absorb most of the lessons, grasping only …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 04:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-04-20:/buy-and-hold.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item></channel></rss>
