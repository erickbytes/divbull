Since beginning in 2018 with approximately $15,000 in savings, I've accrued a six figure portfolio of index funds and stocks with a "DCA and buy and hold" long term mentality. I did this by holding a full time …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2023 20:09:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2023-03-20:/achieving-50-month-in-passive-investing-income.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Volatility, Friend or Foe?</title><link>https://divbull.com/volatility-friend-or-foe.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Volatility is scary because when a stock thrashes down, it hurts pretty bad. Investors need to set aside their emotions and ask themselves, "Has my thesis about this company changed?". If you still have conviction, the market's volatility has created a possible buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple put into words …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 04:20:00 -0600</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2023-01-09:/volatility-friend-or-foe.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Gains Happen in Bursts</title><link>https://divbull.com/gains-happen-in-bursts.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Gains tend to happen quickly in a short time. This is a reason to hold onto those shares a little longer. That sudden unpredictable catalyst might be around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a stock moves, it can happen after years of stagnant price action.

Then they start to cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought they were less brutal, deploying strategies so feudal. Employees are just a line item to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's good for the company? They'll land on their feet. They don't care about a human in the balance sheet …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 12:21:00 -0600</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-11-28:/humans-in-the-balance-sheet.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>The Recession is Bullshit</title><link>https://divbull.com/the-recession-is-bullshit.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I can't shake the feeling that we are being toyed with by invisible forces. First, a disease is manufactured and propagated. Then, a response to the disease is conceived. It includes locking down society and subsidizing the people with printed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a tidy narrative for companies to …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 13:20:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-10-08:/the-recession-is-bullshit.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Check Your Expectations</title><link>https://divbull.com/check-your-expectations.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed Josh Brown's perspective as the market thrashed the past few years. A CNBC regular with razor sharp takes, I think I heard him recently say something to the effect of "check your expectations".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with many things Josh says, but especially with this sentiment.

Intrinsic value is often praised as a claim to why the market price of company should be higher. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;

One can observe the world, watch trends come and go and consider adding them to your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I believe that solar technology is likely to be an …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 14:48:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-08-28:/industry-based-investing.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Buy The Close</title><link>https://divbull.com/buy-the-close.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In my experience, markets sometimes open up with a pump in prices. In situations where I bought near to the open because of some anticipated event, I usually bought at a higher price than if I had waited.&lt;/p&gt;

Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:23:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-07-11:/when-stocks-go-down.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Are We in the "Worst Case" Scenario?</title><link>https://divbull.com/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks are concerned, yes I think so. While the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index is down approximately 15% YTD, many stocks saw anywhere from 30-80% drawdowns. Now one would think selling does not make much sense. Perhaps the inverse of selling is the answer.

We short-sightedly see chaos in our world, and the markets start wavering. I won't tell you what to do now. One lesson of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is that predicting the markets is futile.&lt;/p&gt;

I just wasn't that interested in a subject that mostly flew over my head at age 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class consisted of watching video lectures from a reasonable, jolly Finance professor.
