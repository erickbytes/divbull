Foreign markets, overnight markets and futures offer a look at what the market might do next. Here are my go-to spots to check the market's pulse after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investing.com Futures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking &lt;a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures"&gt;Investing.com futures&lt;/a&gt; is a good signal for coming market reaction to news headlines. It's not a sure-fire indicator of how tomorrow will trade, but it usually gives a good hint at how the market will open up when news breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Robinhood Overnight Market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most stocks now trade on an "overnight" market, which can be seen when checking Robinhood after 8 PM American Central Standard Time. You can check in on the more popular stocks to see how they're trending overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe and Asian Markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany, Japan and Chinese markets may give hints about what is coming tomorrow. If Nvidia stock trades up in Germany, it will likely do the same here. If Nintendo trades up in Japan, its American Depository Receipts (ADRs) tend to see the same price action. I am holding a Japanese growth stock ETF, &lt;a href="https://funds.rayliant.com/rayj/"&gt;RAYJ&lt;/a&gt;. So I often check a watchlist of stocks I hold through it most nights at 6 PM CST when the Japanese markets begin trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin sometimes does act like a tech stock. A reaction move in Bitcoin often foreshadows what tech stocks will do. Other times, it moves inversely to stocks completely, similar to gold. Therefore Bitcoin's price reaction is often a leading indicator since it trades 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These indicators are not something I check every night. Occasionally, when some news breaks, I might check these places to guage what kind of reaction is coming.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blurb"></category></entry><entry><title>A Time Far Away</title><link href="https://divbull.com/a-time-far-away.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-10-07T23:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-07T23:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-10-07:/a-time-far-away.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Investing requires seeing beyond the all around us.

We are emotional creatures who fly off the cuff so easily. It helps to imagine a time far away from our current trials and tribulations as a species. This hypothetical time when the whole world cooperated for the greater good of commerce, prosperity and freedom for every soul on this damn planet. That is the admittedly optimistic bull case to juxtapose to the current environment. How much could the world change in 5, 10 or 20 years? War is disgusting, but I guess it's our current state of affairs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blurb"></category></entry></feed>
