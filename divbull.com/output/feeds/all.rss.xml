In situations where I bought near to the open because of some anticipated event, I usually bought at a higher price than if I had waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it's best to watch stocks throughout the trading day, then …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 15:42:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-07-16:/buy-the-close.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>When Stocks Go Down</title><link>https://divbull.com/when-stocks-go-down.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If a stock goes down, it may still be a good investment. Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Erick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 11:23:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:divbull.com,2022-07-11:/when-stocks-go-down.html</guid><category>Essay</category></item><item><title>Are We in the "Worst Case" Scenario?</title><link>https://divbull.com/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks are concerned, yes I think so. While the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index is down approximately 15% YTD, many stocks saw anywhere from 30-80% drawdowns. Now one would think selling does not make much sense. Perhaps the inverse of selling is the answer.

We short-sightedly see chaos in our world, and the markets start wavering. I won't tell you what to do now. One lesson of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is that predicting the markets is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
