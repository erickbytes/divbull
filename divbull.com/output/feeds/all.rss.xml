Investors need to set aside their emotions and ask themselves, "Has my thesis about this company changed?". If you still have conviction, the market's volatility has created a possible buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

An old investing adage is 'concentration builds wealth', but is that true? I'm not so sure. It depends on the skill + experience of the investor and their conviction to hold the assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought they were less brutal, deploying strategies so feudal. Employees are just a line item to them.&lt;/p&gt;
