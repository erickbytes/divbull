In the past, dividend stocks have held more favor with investors. I find it interesting that recently they've been cast as questionable investment for the long term investor. So what's wrong with getting a cash dividend back from your investments? The market seemed to be selling off these assets in the summer months of 2023. I think this is proof that all the critics come out of the woodwork when a stock's price is trending down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that when a company returns money to its owners, it's a last resort. The company is saying, "We have nothing better to do with this cash pile, so let's give it back it to our shareholders." It's a win-win situation, right? Kind of. Growth stock zealots are quick to point out that the money returned to the company's owners will deflate the stock price in the long run. I guess this is true. Instead of a dividend, a company can also choose to "buy back" its own stock instead, raising the price for shareholders without incurring any taxes. They could also invest in their business to increase future profits. Dividends are seen as characteristic of a business that is in its "declining corporation" phase, rather than its "wait until you see what we're going to do in the future" phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="life cycle of a business" src="https://divbull.com/images/business-life-cycle.jpeg"&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;source, Corporate Finance Institute: https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/business-life-cycle/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, 22% of my savings is allocated into dividend-paying ETFs, mutual funds or stocks. According to Google Finance, my taxable portfolio and self-contributed IRA contain 8% medium dividend investments and 31% high P/E (price to earnings) investments. A stock's higher price to earnings ratio indicates its trading at a multiple of its current earnings and is more likely associated with traditional growth stocks. You have to pay a higher multiple to gain the income streams of these high P/E businesses. I want to invest more into dividend stocks to raise my passive income level. Currently I earn around $50/month from my investments. Most of this is automatically re-invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you earn a dividend, you get to choose if you want to re-invest your dividends or take them as cash in your pocket. An obvious benefit of re-investing them automatically is that you won't have to pay taxes on the dividend. If you take it in cash, you'll need to pay a tax. That tax could have been re-invested instead of going to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all dividends are the same. Yahoo Finance is great for researching dividend yields. It lists the forward dividend &amp;amp; yield of every stock if it pays a dividend. For example, Ford (4.98% yield) and Coca-Cola (3.40%) each yield a larger dividend so I've been scooping up shares. I believe these businesses are rock solid. Thanks to the dividend stock summer sale, they have pulled back from their all-time highs. I'm betting they will still be thriving 30 years from now. Hopefully, their yield will boost my passive income along the way if needed. I like having the option to turn of drip investing and flip them to cash if I need some extra money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3-6% dividend yield is seen as a "goldlocks zone" of dividends. Anything higher than that might be a "value trap", luring in yield chasers to a owning a business with questionable fundamentals. If you are paid a whopping dividend but the price of your shares is decreasing, it offsets your returns. It may not be the best move to invest, despite reaping these giant yields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age is a factor to consider how much you want to commit to dividend versus growth stocks. I'm 33 years old, so I likely have an easy 20-30 years before I'd want to use my invested money, barring emergencies or large purchases where I need to raise cash. If you're younger, the growth stock enthusiasts say you should be more oriented for long term growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the concept of a hybrid "dividend growth" stock. Microsoft (0.90%), Apple (0.54%) and Nvidia (0.04%) are examples of companies with higher P/E ratios that are rapidly growing their business and pay a smaller dividend than Coke or Ford. These types of companies are a happy medium between dividend and growth in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I propose that a mix of dividend and growth stocks is the best approach to investing. Like most things in life, it's not all-or-nothing. Your allocation depends on your financial goals, risk tolerance, salary and age. If your salary is comfortable, you may not need to worry about passive income and can re-invest your cash payouts. If you're unemployed, you can use dividends to spell your expenses. Later in life, you might be lucky enough to live off your dividends. I hope to get there someday!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>The Waiting Game</title><link href="https://divbull.com/the-waiting-game.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-09T15:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-09T15:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-10-09:/the-waiting-game.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of investing is not doing anything at all.

You need to wait for your investments to compound over time. The problem is the narratives that surround your investments. Adding more uncertainty, unexpected "black swan" events like wars and COVID can scare investors into thinking they know what's going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not against actively managing your portfolio. Sometimes, we need to consider new information that changes our theory for why something will be a solid investment. For example, if a company is hemorrhaging money and not showing any signs they will turn it around. But there's still a chance they might figure it out some years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a gray area of investing where risk meets reward. You can choose to stick with an underperformer. If the company eventually dominates their sector and takes market share, leading to profits then you'll be rewarded. More risk, more reward. I personally like to include a few speculative plays in my portfolio, but honestly it doesn't ease your nerves to watch a company you own struggle to reach profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most profitable investment that I'm still holding, Tesla, falls into this category. I thought the world was destined to have an electric vehicle future before many saw the writing on the wall. Before the company turned profitable, I bought a bag of shares with intent to hold for a long time. Luckily, they turned their first annual profit in 2020 and continue to improve their results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the EV theory has paid well and the electric vehicle movement shows no signs of stopping. This story is an example of how you can invest on what you think the world will look like in the future, even if the situation is questionable in the present moment. Just know that it might take longer than you think to play out, or you could be wrong and it never plays out. The friction of this uncertainty in the outcome is what makes investing hard. Sometimes, there are simply better options to reallocate your losses into another more promising company that already has established a sound balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I propose that many times, but not always, the best action is not to make any moves. You've got a large unrealized loss, but how do you know that market volatility won't swing the other way on your position? If you believe the company will be important in the future, hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing is tough because it's easy to be convinced by a stranger or talking head online that they know what's going to happen. More often than not, it's best to play the waiting game. Extend your holding period and the likelihood you'll profit increases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Make Small Bets</title><link href="https://divbull.com/make-small-bets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-09T20:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-08-09T20:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-08-09:/make-small-bets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Small bets can have outsized returns.

If it goes south, you've also got less on the line. Have conviction? Make a larger bet. Not sure about an investment? That's a solid candidate for a small bet. You find out the company's outlook is now questionable or management is not meeting the mark? You could always sell half. However, the largest gains come from letting asset value compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of your bankroll determines your range. Consider making some small bets in stocks, real estate or even starting a business.
There is less stress in a small bet. For me, it's $50-$500 up to $1,000 that I consider a "small bet" in my taxable investor brokerage account. Anything greater than that and it's no longer a "small bet" to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even have some $50 or $100 positions that I might add to someday. This is the magic of stocks. Value tends to go up over time. You could have bought almost any stock at the end of 2022 and would riding gains. At the time, no one knew what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the general outlook for stocks seems favorable, with consensus that the recession is cancelled. Year to date, the market is mostly reacting in a way that suggests we were in the "oversold" range at the end of last year. Are we now overbought? I doubt it, but we'll see! My theory is that now is a still a decent time to open some small bets to gain exposure to exceptional asset value growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My portfolio is tech heavy with some strategic industries like electric vehicles, solar energy and cloud computing. I also reaped some of the sudden 2023 AI buzz in Tesla, Microsoft and Nvidia with tech prices getting a lift pretty much across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is a core position in my portfolio. Nvidia was a medium sized bet that resulted in a 3x bagger gain. It's now a small bet again after I took some profits. Even on a small bet, booking 3x your money is a pleasant payday. After making the original bet in 2020, I'm letting my $1000 cost basis ride in this stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to encourage anyone to get into a high multiple valuation. I say that knowing this semiconductor company is a one of my best small bets currently. Risky or frothy prices might be right for a tiny bet with the possiblity of adding more later on a dip. Sometimes it pays to buy a company on such a trajectory but it honestly scares me to buy it now. So I'm holding my small Nvidia bet for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afterword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not financial advice nor all writing on this blog. Learn to assess the health of a business. It is an art based on valuation, cash flow, profits, management, margins, market share, strategy, reinvesting assets for compounding growth and so on. Investing is unpredictable and risky, sure, but make some small bets. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting Out of LYFT Stock</title><link href="https://divbull.com/getting-out-of-lyft-stock.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-13T12:36:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-13T12:36:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-05-13:/getting-out-of-lyft-stock.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm an advocate for "buy and hold" investing, meaning if you are making an investment it should be for a long period of time before selling.

However, you may need to cut a position due to a company's failure to turn a profit or dependency on bending public policies to their favor. This was the case with LYFT, based in California, the battleground of workers rights that shifted over the years as ridesharing went mainstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a game-changing service to society helping people get where they needed to go. I also moonlighted as a LYFT driver for a few months in 2017, seeing first-hand how they onboarded drivers. LYFT filed an IPO in March 2019. I had $2,600 to invest and wanted a piece of those huge ridesharing profits that were going to happen someday. In retrospect, this was too speculative of an investment. LYFT was growing riders, but profitability hadn't been proven yet. Being in my 20s, I was just starting to invest and eager to start buying stocks with the extra money I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid $65 per share for LYFT shortly after its IPO (Initial Public Offering) in 2019, under the IPO price of $72. Another lesson from this trade is that it more risky to buy an IPO close to its debut in public trading. But I couldn't resist so I put it on LYFT shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I learned from holding LYFT stock is to consider the risk of political impacts on your stocks. In the case of LYFT, they and UBER were typically involved in regulatory battles with the state of California over the classification of their drivers in the past 10 years. Are rideshare driver independent contractors? The debate continues. And each time it blew up on the news, I looked at those shares and thought... I signed up for this? Court battles. A questionable public image and an unprofitable business to boot. Having tried LYFT's rideshare services myself, I thought their culture was strong and they'd be a leader in a promising new industry. We'll see if they ever make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lyftstockprice" src="https://divbull.com/images/lyftstockprice.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They closed around $8 per share yesterday. My investment? Within the first year, I was already down considerably and endured several painful earnings reports. They were nearly profitable, but then were hit hard by pandemic lockdown. I sold out from 2021 to 2022, selling each share at a loss. 90% of the shares were sold in June to October 2021 near the end of the most recent bull market. Only with hindsight, can I now say I feel strongly it was the right call. If I had left the money there, I'd be sitting on $375 in market value in Lyft and over $2,000 of unrealized losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold the position incrementally, ranging from $38 - $63 per share. I sold my last 5 shares at $38 per share in Feb. 2022. Having cleared the position, I now know from experience, there are times when you should cut your losses. In total, I limited the damage to $546 lost and re-allocated the remaining $2K to other investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at LYFT in 2023, it's down 89% over the past 5 years, unprofitable with a real possibility of bankruptcy. Recently, the founders have stepped back from operating the company. They're also low-key saying they're open to a buyout. Maybe they will turn it around, but I'm no longer on the hook for a few grand if they don't. I now try to buy companies that have already established profitability and growing. This is my LYFT story, may we all stay away from such investments and realize quickly if we've miscalculated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Regression to the Sea</title><link href="https://divbull.com/regression-to-the-sea.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-11T21:30:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-11T21:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-05-11:/regression-to-the-sea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A market of stocks reminds me of a school of fish.

They swarm in the same general motion, sometimes using their collective to protect each individual fish with natural deception. Some of the fish are stonger than others, use their competitive advantage to survive and help the other fish. But if a fish becomes too weak, it gets eaten. Same with stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, the stock market was bubbling up together in a cash injected, inflation-fueled blow-out. Then the direction of the tide shifted. After pulling back strongly into summer, a brief respite in July before getting hammered even more, with a possible bottom reached in late December. Warren Buffett once said, "Only when the tide goes out, do you learn who has been swimming naked." It's the weaker companies burning through cash struggling to survive. They get metaphorically eaten. Thankfully, stocks are starting to bounce back. It's now a "stock picker's market" or so I've heard. If you bought anything in December, you're probably up a decent amount on the investment. In a few cases, my new positions and DCA buys from within the past 6 months are up 80%. Of course, I'm still down 30%-60% or [gasp] more on too many positions. Regardless, I tend to buy and hold with an option to sell at breakeven if I don't like the company's power structure or earnings reports. I can wait a long time and intend to do so with all my stocks. Sidebar: did you know whales can live up to 90 years? They're probably good investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like fish, stocks valuations are loosely tied together, especially at an industry level. If prices go up a lot, they'll probably reverse eventually. If they recently pulled back hard, there is a better chance for growth at a reasonable price. Sometimes you have to load up when a stock is down over 20% in a single day. When all hope is lost, yet another regression but this time upwards after you bought it if you chose well. It's not always going to work out, but lowering your cost average is generally considered a good idea in investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, no one really knows what the market will do. The stock market's short-term direction is about as random as a school of fish. When the market regresses to the mean and sells off: buy the fish that is consistently makes the right moves. It has these characteristics: quickly acquires customers and keeps them, protects or grows their product profit margin, survives economic drawdowns, socially responsible and guides earnings appropriately. That's a catch!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>10 Ways I Keep Up With My Stocks</title><link href="https://divbull.com/10-ways-i-keep-up-with-my-stocks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-22T14:09:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-04-22T14:09:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2023-04-22:/10-ways-i-keep-up-with-my-stocks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post summarizes ways that I keep tabs on the companies I'm holding in my investment portfolio.

I tend to hold stocks for a long time, regardless of stock price movements. It helps to see the whole picture, industry, customer mentality and metrics like free cash flow and profits. These are ways I try to glean insights into a company's future potential or lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are 10 ways I keep up with my stocks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Charles Schwab investor checking account to buy assets + make trades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch CNBC for free in the Charles Schwab mobile app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track dividends received in Charles Schwab account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance/"&gt;Google Finance&lt;/a&gt; to manage watchlists and monitor daily prices. Schwab also has a watchlist but I prefer Google Finance's UI for watching short term price movements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the company "in the wild".&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If public, visit the company and observe what you see. Is it a well run operation? Are customers happy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note the frequency you see people choosing the company's products day to day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus points if you are the customer, you know intimately what value the company is creating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earnings calls: listen to the call live or most companies post the call transcript online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read investing blogs and books from the greats. I subscribe to my followed blogs via an RSS feed. Here are a few I recommend:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/"&gt;The Reformed Broker&lt;/a&gt;, Josh Brown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/"&gt;Of Dollars and Data&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Magiulli&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Benjamin Graham, Intelligent Investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peter Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warren Buffett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor sentiment with Twitter and Reddit. Read the Twitter cashtags for individual stocks and browse social media for overall sentiment monitoring. Beware there are emotional posters with an agenda, opinion or position that may contradict yours. I find it useful for gaining a sense of general feelings about the market or shares in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use finance Python libraries, like &lt;a href="https://pmorissette.github.io/ffn/"&gt;ffn&lt;/a&gt; to see more complex financial calculation about a stock. I wrote in depth about the endless tools you can apply for financial calculation &lt;a href="https://pythonmarketer.com/2021/01/16/pick-stocks-like-a-pro-with-ffn/"&gt;here on my other blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk to people about their investments. What are they investing in? What's working for them? What are they excited about? They have a perspective that differs from yours that exposes you to a new concept or industry.&lt;/li&gt;

Since beginning in 2018 with approximately $15,000 in savings, I've accrued a six figure portfolio of funds and stocks with a "DCA and buy and hold" long term mentality. I did this by holding a full time job and earning multiple pay increases along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50% of my retirement funds are in a managed employer match 401(k) with a different bank. My primary bank is Charles Schwab. Most of my self-directed IRA is collecting dividends with Schwab index funds (SCHB, SWPPX and SWTSX) and MSFT. My self directed IRA has a smaller weight of non-dividend growth stocks also. In my taxable portfolio, the core dividend earners are stocks like MSFT, NKE, AAPL, F and NVDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 3-5% of my investment portfolio is committed to cryptocurrency assets. After buying incrementally from December 2020 to 2022, I now have market value exceeding $5,500 staked in Ethereum. Approximately 60% of my crypto portfolio is in ETH, followed by 25% Bitcoin, which does not have a staking protocol. Over the past 7 months, my staking rewards netted me $12.48 per month by my calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Investing Income Breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Stock Dividends:    $38/month&lt;br&gt;
Ethereum Staking:   $12.48/month&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined, they add up to a investment income of $50/month and counting with time. Hold dividend stocks and index funds. Stake Ethereum, if you can handle elevated risk that surrounds crypto. Then again, with the recent banking shakeout, maybe a more decentralized store of value is intriguing. Find a job or start a business, keep saving and reap the rewards of investing. This is how I achieved a new level of passive income. In both, their dividends are automatically re-invested.&lt;/p&gt;

Investors need to set aside their emotions and ask themselves, "Has my thesis about this company changed?". If you still have conviction, the market's volatility has created a possible buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds simple put into words, but observing the market in real time never goes so smoothly. Your perceptions of a "bottom" or a stock's range can be way off. Volatility is an opportunistic investor's friend, and a timid or inexperienced investor's foe. However, even a seasoned pro can get it disastorously wrong and get wiped out by a falling knife. Make volatility your friend, but be careful!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Should You Hold 5 Stocks or 30?</title><link href="https://divbull.com/should-you-hold-5-stocks-or-30.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-15T01:34:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-15T01:34:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-12-15:/should-you-hold-5-stocks-or-30.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The topic of how many stocks you should hold is ambiguous.

An old investing adage is 'concentration builds wealth', but is that true? I'm not so sure. It depends on the skill + experience of the investor and their conviction to hold the assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a retail investor with less experience, I keep a diversified portfolio of stocks and index funds. I'm holding around 50 stocks and funds. Diversification lowers your risk and exposure to any given individual position. However, I do realize that concentration yields benefits like intricately focusing on the companies your money is riding with. Investing is an art steeped in allocation. When conviction (and profits) are high, I think it's acceptable to keep a higher allocation of such securities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Muse"></category></entry><entry><title>Gains Happen in Bursts</title><link href="https://divbull.com/gains-happen-in-bursts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-14T11:22:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-14T11:22:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-12-14:/gains-happen-in-bursts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gains tend to happen quickly in a short time.

First, a disease is manufactured and propagated. Then, a response to the disease is conceived. It includes locking down society and subsidizing the people with printed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a tidy narrative for companies to retrofit to their own needs. A cycle of boom and bust is synthesized in the name of the greater good. Employers now have a reason to fire their employees and raise prices of their widgets. Stocks suffer because it's going to be difficult. Everyone knows a recession is coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear mounts. Worries pile up. The Federal Bank must curb inflation. They need to raise interest rates on borrowing money to get this nasty inflation monster under control. Now it costs more money for people to take out a loan and buy houses. Companies don't give raises. Inflation of consumer staples eat into our salaries. "The recession is coming!", they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summation, we have a (natural?) phenomena, seized by world governments to extend their power in the name of protecting the people. Stocks go down for now. That's ok as a long term investor. However, I can't get over the idea that is all humans, all the way down. Humans doing human things: scheming, reacting and seizing an opportunity to claim the sky is falling. All along, fat cats padding their own pockets at the expense of their fellow man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think a recession will happen? Is it already happening? Or is it only our reaction to the idea of it? I, for one, find it amusing how humans can be so sure they know what is coming and what has already happened. I'm a skeptic!

&lt;p&gt;Checking Investopedia, the top hit on Google, "There is no universal standard for calculating the intrinsic value of a company... Typically, investors try to use both qualitative and quantitative to measure the intrinsic value of a company, but investors should keep in mind that the result is still only an estimate." - Investopedia, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next hit, Corporate Finance Institute offers a "Net Present Value" based formula, along with net cash flow, interest rate, etc. So it seems that the mathematics of instrinsic value calculation are sound, but the weighting of possible future outcomes is where an an analyst is more of an artist.
https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/intrinsic-value-guide/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, intrinsic value is a mathematical model an analyst creates by weighing projected outcomes. There is no standard for producing an intrinsic valuation of a company. I find this somewhat amusing, because before when I heard the term intrinsic valuation, I  assumed there was more to it. Such as a formal methodology that is carried out. However, like all future prediction models, they are subjective and sound more like a guess to me. I will be sure to take these instrinsic value calculations with a grain of salt from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Industry-Based Investing</title><link href="https://divbull.com/industry-based-investing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-08-28:/industry-based-investing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When picking investments, I like the idea of selecting assets based on their industry or the rise of a specific technology.

One can observe the world, watch trends come and go and consider adding them to your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I believe that solar technology is likely to be an important source of energy in the future. I am basing this thesis on an anecdotal conversation with an energy engineer, along with generally positive sentiment for the solar energy industry as of late. For these reasons, I am marginally invested and building a position in a solar company, Sunrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles are another industry that I believe will play a big part in the future of humanity, so I'm holding Tesla. It's been my best investment by far. I'm still holding because I believe that electric vehicles are going to be huge in the future. One can hold a company based on principle, provided the quarterly earnings reports are acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your thesis will be wrong. You can't win 'em all. You also don't need to win them all. Pick a few winners and mix with index funds to round out your portfolio and the 80\20 rule will emerge. A few of your assets will perform better than the others and reap most of your gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this industry-based line of thinking is a way to frame your investments that can make it easy to remember why you're holding it. One can certainly be wrong about our projections into the future, but these are the types of angles a keen investor seeks out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Ramblings About Stock Prices, DCA and Cash Position</title><link href="https://divbull.com/ramblings-about-stock-prices-dca-and-cash-position.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-06T17:53:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-06T17:53:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-08-06:/ramblings-about-stock-prices-dca-and-cash-position.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have realized a common idea most probably do.

Predicting short term price movements is like picking black correctly in roulette. However, if the price does go down, that can often be a good thing for opportunistic and long term thinking investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knobs and levers that influence the stock market are many. Stocks popped in July 2022. After 6 months that pummeled portfolios, we saw a massive buying response. Savvy investors must see opportunities in this hellscape of shriveled securities. So are we in the clear? Have stocks been "derisked"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trick question, stocks always include risk. The idea that anyone is certain about the price movement of any stock is pure poppycock. Only time will tell how high or low a stock can go. If the business's balance sheet and business prospects are strong it's easier to hold on for the ride when the market heads down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days and months, it's impossible to know what will happen. War, inflation, disease and a public infatuation with the idea of a recession means it's all probably already priced in. July supported this idea with buying coming back in style. Or maybe the overall downward 2022 trend will continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My portfolio is down 18% YTD, not far off the S&amp;amp;P 500 index which is down about 13% YTD. After the July run-up, I want to build a large cash position, while making monthly contributions to max out my retirement IRA. I'm also hoping catch further drawdowns when they happen or hold a little more cash than usual. I've been steadily dollar cost averaging into my stocks and index funds during the recent downturn and that will continue, regardless of where we go from here. My most recent buys were adding to my S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund and adding to a minor YETI stock position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aggressively invested with a large portion of your net worth in stocks and index funds makes you realize the luxury and life comfort you gain from holding a little extra cash. I'm hearing the dollar is stonger than the Euro now. My two weeks in Europe in 2011 tell me how shocking that is considering its superiority at the time. I'm allocated at 4% cash right now, but 10% cash seems a desirable spot to be due to my personal circumstances. Then I'll be able to pick my spots, while making regular contributions and have a little extra cash to live my life and pay the bills, travel and maybe even have a mini-retirement!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Rant"></category></entry><entry><title>Buy The Close</title><link href="https://divbull.com/buy-the-close.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-16:/buy-the-close.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my experience, markets sometimes open up with a pump in prices.

Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can have broad-sweeping effects on all stocks and index funds regardless of company performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors like growing companies. In recessionary times, investors like profitable companies with stable product demand. Therefore, the companies that are less profitable now but investing heavily in the future may be undervalued currently compared to their potentially more developed, profitable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks like NET and SNOW are tech infrastructure plays that have been hit hard by the flight to more established companies. Their underlying bull theses are still in tact. Today, they are priced at a 50%-60% discount compared to their price at the beginning of 2022. The recent market turbulence is allowing me to lower my cost basis on both positions. In the long run, savvy investors will repurpose this downturn into an opportunity. I'm betting that will be the case with these two promising companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stocks will go down and it is not necessarily an indicator of weakness. Trust your convictions and consider tuning out the stop loss daytrader heros. Sure, it's fine to cut losses. However, sometimes it's necessary to hold your shares "in the red" until conditions improve.
