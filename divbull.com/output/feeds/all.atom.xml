First, a disease is manufactured and propagated. Then, a response to the disease is conceived. It includes locking down socienty and supplementing the people with printed money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all a tidy narrative for companies to retrofit to their own needs. A cycle of boom and bust is synthesized in the name of the greater good. Employers now have a reason to fire their employees and raise prices of their widgets. Stocks suffer because it's going to be difficult. Everyone knows a recession is coming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear mounts. Worries pile up. The Federal Bank must curb inflation. They need to raise interest rates on borrowing money to get this nasty inflation monster under control. Now it costs more money for people to take out a loan and buy houses. Companies don't give raises. Inflation of consumer staples eat into our salaries. "The recession is coming!", they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summation, we have a (natural?) phenomena, seized by world governments to extend their power in the name of protecting the people. Stocks go down for now. That's ok as a long term investor. However, I can't get over the idea that is all humans, all the way down. Humans doing human things: scheming, reacting and seizing an opportunity to claim the sky is falling. All along, fat cats padding their own pockets at the expense of their fellow man!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think a recession will happen? Is it already happening? Or is it only our reaction to the idea of it? I, for one, find it amusing how humans can be so sure they know what is coming and what has already happened. I'm a skeptic! This recession is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>A Time Far Away</title><link href="https://divbull.com/a-time-far-away.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-10-07T23:26:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-10-07T23:26:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-10-07:/a-time-far-away.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Investing requires seeing beyond the all around us.

Intrinsic value is often praised as a claim to why the market price of company should be higher. What does that mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking Investopedia, the top hit on Google, "There is no universal standard for calculating the intrinsic value of a company... Typically, investors try to use both qualitative and quantitative to measure the intrinsic value of a company, but investors should keep in mind that the result is still only an estimate." - Investopedia, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/intrinsicvalue.asp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next hit, Corporate Finance Institute offers a "Net Present Value" based formula, along with net cash flow, interest rate, etc. So it seems that the mathematics of instrinsic value calculation are sound, but the weighting of possible future outcomes is where an an analyst is more of an artist.
https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/valuation/intrinsic-value-guide/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, intrinsic value is a mathematical model an analyst creates by weighing projected outcomes. There is no standard for producing an intrinsic valuation of a company. I find this somewhat amusing, because before when I heard the term intrinsic valuation, I  assumed there was more to it. Such as a formal methodology that is carried out. However, like all future prediction models, they are subjective and sound more like a guess to me. I will be sure to take these instrinsic value calculations with a grain of salt from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Industry-Based Investing</title><link href="https://divbull.com/industry-based-investing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-28T14:48:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-08-28:/industry-based-investing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When picking investments, I like the idea of selecting assets based on their industry or the rise of a specific technology.

One can observe the world, watch trends come and go and consider adding them to your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I believe that solar technology is likely to be an important source of energy in the future. I am basing this thesis on an anecdotal conversation with an energy engineer, along with generally positive sentiment for the solar energy industry as of late. For these reasons, I am marginally invested and building a position in a solar company, Sunrun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicles are another industry that I believe will play a big part in the future of humanity, so I'm holding Tesla. It's been my best investment by far. I'm still holding because I believe that electric vehicles are going to be huge in the future. One can hold a company based on principle, provided the quarterly earnings reports are acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes your thesis will be wrong. You can't win 'em all. You also don't need to win them all. Pick a few winners and mix with index funds to round out your portfolio and the 80\20 rule will emerge. A few of your assets will perform better than the others and reap most of your gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that this industry-based line of thinking is a way to frame your investments that can make it easy to remember why you're holding it. One can certainly be wrong about our projections into the future, but these are the types of angles a keen investor seeks out.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Ramblings About Stock Prices, DCA and Cash Position</title><link href="https://divbull.com/ramblings-about-stock-prices-dca-and-cash-position.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-08-06T17:53:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-08-06T17:53:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-08-06:/ramblings-about-stock-prices-dca-and-cash-position.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have realized a common idea most probably do.

Predicting short term price movements is like picking black correctly in roulette. However, if the price does go down, that can often be a good thing for opportunistic and long term thinking investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knobs and levers that influence the stock market are many. Stocks popped in July 2022. After 6 months that pummeled portfolios, we saw a massive buying response. Savvy investors must see opportunities in this hellscape of shriveled securities. So are we in the clear? Have stocks been "derisked"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trick question, stocks always include risk. The idea that anyone is certain about the price movement of any stock is pure poppycock. Only time will tell how high or low a stock can go. If the business's balance sheet and business prospects are strong it's easier to hold on for the ride when the market heads down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days and months, it's impossible to know what will happen. War, inflation, disease and a public infatuation with the idea of a recession means it's all probably already priced in. July supported this idea with buying coming back in style. Or maybe the overall downward 2022 trend will continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My portfolio is down 18% YTD, not far off the S&amp;amp;P 500 index which is down about 13% YTD. After the July run-up, I want to build a large cash position, while making monthly contributions to max out my retirement IRA. I'm also hoping catch further drawdowns when they happen or hold a little more cash than usual. I've been steadily dollar cost averaging into my stocks and index funds during the recent downturn and that will continue, regardless of where we go from here. My most recent buys were adding to my S&amp;amp;P 500 index fund and adding to a minor YETI stock position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aggressively invested with a large portion of your net worth in stocks and index funds makes you realize the luxury and life comfort you gain from holding a little extra cash. I'm hearing the dollar is stonger than the Euro now. My two weeks in Europe in 2011 tell me how shocking that is considering its superiority at the time. I'm allocated at 4% cash right now, but 10% cash seems a desirable spot to be due to my personal circumstances. Then I'll be able to pick my spots, while making regular contributions and have a little extra cash to live my life and pay the bills, travel and maybe even have a mini-retirement!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Rant"></category></entry><entry><title>Buy The Close</title><link href="https://divbull.com/buy-the-close.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-16T15:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-16:/buy-the-close.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my experience, markets sometimes open up with a pump in prices.

&lt;p&gt;I find it's best to watch stocks throughout the trading day, then put in a buy order in the final hours or minutes before the market closes for the day. This is general knowledge for most investors and traders. While not always a certainty, I think it is a good tip to keep in mind when adding to your portfolio on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;

Some investors act like a stock you own should never go down, and if it does it's not something you should invest in. This view is unreasonable because as we've seen in 2022, market and geo-political conditions can have broad-sweeping effects on all stocks and index funds regardless of company performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors like growing companies. In recessionary times, investors like profitable companies with stable product demand. Therefore, the companies that are less profitable now but investing heavily in the future may be undervalued currently compared to their potentially more developed, profitable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks like NET and SNOW are tech infrastructure plays that have been hit hard by the flight to more established companies. Their underlying bull theses are still in tact. Today, they are priced at a 50%-60% discount compared to their price at the beginning of 2022. The recent market turbulence is allowing me to lower my cost basis on both positions. In the long run, savvy investors will repurpose this downturn into an opportunity. I'm betting that will be the case with these two promising companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes stocks will go down and it is not necessarily an indicator of weakness. Trust your convictions and consider tuning out the stop loss daytrader heros. Sure, it's fine to cut losses. However, sometimes it's necessary to hold your shares "in the red" until conditions improve. Your positions will recover faster if when stocks get cheaper, you buy more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Are We in the "Worst Case" Scenario?</title><link href="https://divbull.com/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-07-10T11:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-07-10T11:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Erick</name></author><id>tag:divbull.com,2022-07-10:/are-we-in-the-worst-case-scenario.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As far as stocks are concerned, yes I think so.

&lt;p&gt;I'm not calling a bottom. Stock valuations are unpredictable and since the trend is down, prices might go lower.

&lt;p&gt;One lesson stood out from my professor, who seemed to know his field... "Buy and Hold". Nothing revolutionary but it was the first time someone had introduced me to this simple philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning and hanging onto a stock usually outperforms other more short-sighted investing or trading schemes. It stuck with me. While I have my share of bad investments, the philosophy holds weight and guided me towards some profitable ideas. I continue to hold my highest conviction securities and hold small positions if I am less sure about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid investment held on a 5, 10 or 30 year investment horizon will probably appreciate in value. Historically, this is true for many stocks.

&lt;p&gt;Investing in its nature is incurring risk to reap rewards. Index funds keep your risk low and are safe play.
