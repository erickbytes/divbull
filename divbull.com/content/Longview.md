It's hard to imagine what life could look like in 30 years. We short-sightedly see chaos in our world, and the markets start wavering. I won't tell you what to do now. One lesson of Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is that predicting the markets is futile.

A perspective beyond this current slot of time with assets steadily growing is possible. Index funds all but guarantee it. However, if you bought index funds at the beginning of 2022, you lost approximately 15%. Worst 1st half in the stock market since 1970! That's tough, but don't worry. In 10, 20, or 30 years all will be fine. Keep the longview.
