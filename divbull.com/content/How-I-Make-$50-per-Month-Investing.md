In March 2023, I achieved a new milestone of passive investing. Since beginning in 2019 with approximately $15,000 in savings, I've accrued a six figure portfolio of index funds and stocks with a "DCA and buy and hold" long term mentality. I achieved this by holding a full time job throughout the time period.

About 50% of my retirement funds are in a managed employer match 401(k) with a different bank. My primary bank is Charles Schwab. Most of my self-directed IRA is collecting dividends with Schwab index funds (SCHB, SWPPX and SWTSX) and MSFT. My self directed IRA has a smaller weight of non-dividend growth stocks also. In my taxable portfolio, the core dividend earners are stocks like MSFT, NKE, AAPL, F and NVDA.

Additionally, 3-5% of my investment portfolio is committed to cryptocurrency. After buying incrementally from December 2020 to 2022, I now have a market value above $5,000 invested and staked in Ethereum. Approximately %60 of my crypto portfolio is in 
ETH, followed by %25 Bitcoin, which does not have a staking protocol. Over the past 7 months, my staking rewards netted me $12.48 per month by my calculations.

**Passive Investing Income Breakdown**<br>
Stock Dividends 	$38/month<br>
Ethereum Staking 	$12.48/month<br>

Those are 2 ways I found to make passive income of $50/month and counting with time. Hold dividend stocks and index funds. Stake Ethereum, if you can handle elevated risk that surrounds crypto. Find a job or start a business, keep saving and reap the rewards of investing. This is how I achieved a new level of passive income.
