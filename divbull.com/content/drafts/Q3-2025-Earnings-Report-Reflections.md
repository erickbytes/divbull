**Macro**

The Q3 2025 earnings season was preceded by a stunning recovery of the stock market.
Q1 unfolded before "liberation day" at the beginning of April, followed by a rebound in May,
June and July. August and September were seasonally strong this year.

Rate cuts arrived with much fanfare in September. October, typically a poor month for stock market performance,
continued upward trends. However, November has been a month of unwinding the post tariff run of appreciating stock prices.

Now we sit 1 week before Thanksgiving with the seasonal fear arriving in November, a month that stocks typically go up in price historically.

**Q3 Earnings**

Given this macro context, it shouldn't be so surprising that stocks are performing poorly during Q4.

Staples in my portfolio like Nvidia, Microsoft and Google all reported impressive numbers. META has 
been a recent laggard, with its capex hit seemingly reducing its attractiveness. 

Duolingo stock has performed horrendously, but I'm not planning to sell. Their earnings report spooked investors because their bookings are heading down in the short term. It feels like a "kitchen sink" quarter. Throw out the numbers and make a statement that you're adjusting strategy. I am ok with managment's decisions because they are favoring long term user growth and educational course quality improvements. Holding my shares and looking for more data in the future.

Oracle seems to be in a lull recently. They saw a huge stock price jump off their reported Remaining Performance obligations in Q2. Only Oracle and Nike are left to announce a Q3 report in my portfolio.
