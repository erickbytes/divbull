After the post-market session closes for the night, I tend to check in on the market at night in a few different places. Foreign markets, overnight markets and futures offer a look at what the market might do next. Here are my go-to spots to check the market's pulse after dark.

+ Investing.com Futures

Checking [Investing.com futures](https://www.investing.com/indices/indices-futures) is a good signal for coming market reaction to news headlines. It's not a sure-fire indicator of how tomorrow will trade, but it usually gives a good hint at how the market will open up when news breaks.

+ Robinhood Overnight Market

Most stocks now trade on an "overnight" market, which can be seen when checking Robinhood after 8 PM American Central Standard Time. You can check in on the more popular stocks to see how they're trending overnight.

+ Europe and Asian Markets

Germany, Japan and Chinese markets may give hints about what is coming tomorrow. If Nvidia stock trades up in Germany, it will likely do the same here. If Nintendo trades up in Japan, its American Depository Receipts (ADRs) tend to see the same price action. I am holding a Japanese growth stock ETF, [RAYJ](https://funds.rayliant.com/rayj/). So I often check a watchlist of stocks I hold through it most nights at 6 PM CST when the Japanese markets begin trading.

+ Bitcoin

Bitcoin sometimes does act like a tech stock. A reaction move in Bitcoin often foreshadows what tech stocks will do. Other times, it moves inversely to stocks completely, similar to gold. Therefore Bitcoin's price reaction is often a leading indicator since it trades 24/7.

These indicators are not something I check every night. Occasionally, when some news breaks, I might check these places to guage what kind of reaction is coming.
