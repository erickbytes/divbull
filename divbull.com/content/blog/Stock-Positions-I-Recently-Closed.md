I've begun a major consolidation of my investing portfolio. Since I am raising money from 
my portfolio to buy a house, I have been selling larger amounts than I typically would.
At the time of writing, I have built my cash position to 56% of my goal needed to pay and close
the deal to become an owner of my first house.


I've opted to draw funds from a mix of top performers and underperformers. I've so far taken only a 
small portion of the best performers. In some of my underperformers, I've chosen to sell out completely 
of some of them that are smaller holdings. Since these are very small positions, so these do not represent 
much capital in the context of my whole portfolio.

Here is the list of underperformers that I no longer own:

**RIVN**

I had poor timing to enter Rivian near $23. I bought more at $14. It basically has slowly declined since 2022.
The business is executing their plan, but it's tough to get excited about a business that is losing thousands
of dollars per car they sell. I closed out at a $350 loss. Small position that I couldn't justify holding any 
longer after holding for 2 years. I hope they succeed, but it seems like this could take a long time before 
profits arrive. It's possible they might never turn that corner. Maybe they will.
 
**PINS**

Pinterest has a lot of good qualities. Social media pairs well with ad revenue. Growing monthly active users.
Popular with the highly desired Gen Z youths segment. Building AI ad tools for businesses to market on their platform. 
I always thought I'd see this stock pop but it didn't materialize. I would get back to breakeven, only to be down 30-40% 
on the position 6 months later. This happened multiple times. I closed out for ~$300 loss. Now it will probably see 
that upward price movement that I waited 4 years to never see. One problem was my initial entry was in 2021, 
an ill-fated year for stock picking. I bought the dip, but not enough to ever get into serious profits on a position 
that never rose above $2,000.

**FSLR**

I feel like I personally saw the importance of solar energy in our future. Unfortunately the current government policies
are threatening renewable energy in the United States. This year has been particularly ridiculous. Solar stocks continually 
have their government subsidies threatened to be taken away, then given back every week. Such are the times. I decided that 
I didn't want to hold solar stocks in this turbulent environment. Could First Solar go higher here? Absolutely. Could it go lower? 
Definitely possible as well. I've determined this company to be the "best bet" in solar in my book. Regardless, I closed because
it feels very volatile holding solar stocks right now. I sold out more or less at my cost basis, booking a slight profit.

Additionally, I closed out two positions that performed well but were small positions. I sold in an effort to reduce the total number
of stocks I'm invested in.

**VST**

Vistra Energy is a very promising company in the very hot energy trend. They operate in the natural gas and 
nuclear energy spaces. I rode the stock from $140, added a few shares at $110, back up to over $200. I sold 
because I only held 10 shares and feel there is a strong chance of retracement to the $150 level or below. 
Or maybe it will keep on mooning. It was one of the best performers in the S&P 500 in 2024. I closed out for 
a $600 profit, successfully trading the shares for a profit in less than a year and riding the greater energy 
demand trend. If shares dipped back under $150, I'd consider getting back in long.

**AAPL**

Apple is a philosophically conflicting company for me. While I recognize they will likely continue to execute 
their game, sell lots of phones and reap profits, I do not approve of how they go about their business. Apple 
is no longer a technological innovator. They are collecting rent on their past success via unfair app store practices 
and other nefarious activites, like creating a rift between iPhone users and Android for years by refusing to support RCS
messaging. Therefore, I cashed the final 5 shares in my portfolio and will play the upside in my S&P 500 fund. 
It wasn't much of a position, but in the name of consolidation and looking for better opportunities, I took profits.
I'm no longer holding Apple shares.

**Portfolio Reflection**

My portfolio holdings now consist of 38 individual stocks, 12 cryptocurrencies, 3 mutual funds, 2 ETFs and a 
401(k) target date fund. At the end of 2023, I was holding 52 stocks. In that time, my portfolio has churned 
considerably. I've sold other stocks and added new stocks. The core has been stable, with some new 1-3% positions 
added. 

I've decided that I want to hold less stocks. Maybe the stocks I sell will go on to become great stocks, 
but I can't stick with them when I believe there are better opportunities elsewhere.

My goal is to get down to around 15-20 individual stocks in my portfolio, in addition to my other funds and ETFs. 
I will be happy if I can achieve that, because keeping up with the earnings reports of 40-50 stocks is like a 
full-time job during some 2-3 week spans every quarter. After following 50 companies for a few years, I feel 
it was beneficial to see the difference between how top tier companies and lower quality businesses handled recession 
fears, tariffs and operational problems. I think the reps I took following so many companies will help me better assess the companies 
I own in the future. With that said, I look forward to consolidating further into my highest conviction stock picks.
