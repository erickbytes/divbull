**Kraken Introduces Bonded Bitcoin Staking**

I recently achieved a new passive income stream by tapping into my long Bitcoin holdings.
Thanks to Kraken's new [bonded Bitcoin staking](https://support.kraken.com/articles/overview-of-bitcoin-staking-on-kraken)
I'm now earning 0.25%-1% APR in interest against my Bitcoin.

Previously, Bitcoin required "bridging" to other assets or other more complex maneuvers in order to earn 
staking rewards. For comparison, Ethereum and Solana have native staking. Bitcoin is now able to earn 
staking rewards, without needing to leave its native blockchain, in exchange for securing the network 
by locking up your assets for up to 10 days before you can unstake.

This is a significant win for me. I estimate my Bitcoin holdings would yield approximately $175 per year 
if I could achieve a 1% yield. The exciting part is the compounding this could enable by reinvesting the earnings
back into Bitcoin or other assets. I'm 35 years old, so this means I will invest an extra $5,000 
into bitcoin by the time I'm 70. This number assumes I live that long, stay invested and continue to reinvest the 
staking rewards.It's a new income stream that Kraken has enabled that I previously didn't have.

No matter what Bitcoin's price does, I will continue to earn rewards. I don't plan to sell any bitcoin anytime soon.
So the 7 day lockup associated with unbonding does not worry me at all. Someday, I might reduce holdings to diversify 
and reallocate elsewhere, but I believe I'll hold Bitcoin for the rest of my life. I might as well earn yield against this asset.

**How It Works**

Kraken has teamed up with the Babylon protocol to allow Bitcoin holders to collect staking rewards against your sats.
It took my Bitcoin about 45 minutes to transfer into Kraken. Once on the exchange, it's very easy to "allocate" 
your bitcoin to bonded staking and takes less than 5 minutes once your assets are on Kraken. Once you've done this, 
you'll receive a weekly payout in BABY tokens. 

My first payout was $0.21, about 4.9 BABY coins. One quirk of holding the BABY tokens is that you need to 
accumulate about 25 tokens before you can convert the tokens back into Bitcoin.

This is an awesome opportunity that Kraken has enabled for extra passive income against the king of crypto assets.
If you're holding Bitcoin, do some research into yield opportunities for your holdings. It can potentially become a new income stream.
