Title: 2025 Reflections

It has been a crazy year to be an investor. The emotional stock market roller coaster has brought
good times and bad. The good times were set to roll in January, only to "roll over" in May and April.
We saw the bottom of a 20%+ index drawdown. My net worth was sliding lower and lower until 
"liberation day" marked a local bottom. From that point on, the bounce was on in May, June and July.
It felt great riding that wave back up.

In the fall the market continued to melt up. Many called for a pullback in October, citing its seasonally 
historic weakness for the stock market. The market held steady until November arrived, and then the selloff commenced.
This despite the fact that November has historically strong stock market returns.

Now we sit at the end of November, with many gains having evaporated over the past 3 months in higher beta growth stocks.
Where do we go from here? I wish I knew, but is it too much to ask for the traditional "santa rally"?

In spite of the recent pullback, I'm feeling fine. I have a diversified, more focused portfolio than ever before.
I also banked a large amount of profits in September and October. In hindsight, it was a good time short term to take 
some profits. In my case, I recently completed the purchase of my first home. This was the reason I sold a lot of stocks
when the market was still riding high in August and September. Many of my stocks have since decreased from prices I sold at. It is necessary to cash profits from time to time so that when a market drawdown inevitably hits, it eases the pain knowing you took some capital off the table.

I feel great after completing this maneuver. I am a long term investor who has made profits in the stock market.
I struggle with recognizing when to take profits occasionally. In this case, my decision to buy a house forced 
me to free up capital at a local top. I still believe in my investments long term, but I have a feeling that I 
cashed in some profits at a relatively good time to sell. Occasionally, we need to take profits. But we shouldn't 
lose sight of possible "never sell" opportunities like Nvidia or Tesla. These businesses will likely continue compounding
long after you take profits. However, I did cash some Nvidia, Microsoft and Tesla shares for example. In most of these cases, I didn't sell out of 100% of my shares, so I maintain some long exposure. Nvidia is currently my top single stock position, followed by Microsoft, then Tesla. I sold at least 10-25% from most of my long positions to fund the house. I even convinced myself to sell a chunk of Bitcoin at $108K, which was hard to do at the time. Even after divesting some Bitcoin, I have a high exposure to cryptocurrencies at nearly 8% of my net worth. Now only 59% of my net worth is correlated with stocks, and 8% in crypto, down from approximately ~88% stocks and ~12% crypto before I bought the house.

It wasn't all profit taking to fund the house. I also sold some losers like Pinterest, Chainlink and Shiba Inu cryptocurrencies. They're all down 30%+ in the past few months, so I'm happy I sold out a small loss or breakeven. I cashed out of Ferrari shares just above breakeven, which was a good move after they plunged under $400 recently. I sold half of my small Chipotle position at a loss. Sold more than half of my Ford and Coca Cola dividend stocks for gains. Reduced exposure to long term winners like Alibaba, Roblox, Costco, Cloudflare and Crowdstrike, by taking profits. Traded around some Meta, MercadoLibre, Nintendo and Reddit shares to book short term profits. Sold out completely from Amazon, since I have plenty of Magnificent 7 exposure already with Microsoft. Tax loss harvested losers like Crocs and Figma to reduce my payments to the government next year. Sold Disney shares for marginal profit and reduced the position by 66%. Reduced my SOXX ETF semiconductors position by 90% after it performed very well from the bottom in April. I also sold 45% of my S&P 500 fund for marginal gain. All of these decisions freed up capital to purchase a home and stock it with necessities. To fund the house, I drew liquidity came from both my winner and loser investments. The source of funds were not an overly big contribution from any one holding. I was able to draw it in a distributed manner from my portfolio over a span of 3 months to accomplish my goal.

2025 was a marquee year for me. I now have a wife and purchased my first house. My wife and I have a permanent place to live. I now have an estimated 32% of my net worth in my home's equity. I still have a significant exposure to individual stocks at 40% of my net worth. Including my retirement mutual funds and ETFs, approximately 59% of my net worth is currently exposed to the stock market. I feel happy because the house will save us huge amounts versus rent payments, and instead we can spend that money to improve where we live. Not to mention I am more diversified in real estate. 
I've already felt the benefit of this diversification because of the recent market dip that arrived in November.
Thankfully my house's value doesn't move in correlation with the recent stock market downturn.

All in all, I'm feeling grateful. Cashing out of the stock market at a relatively high tide gave me the liquidity to improve the way I live while maintaining my exposure to the stock market. That's something we can all strive towards. That's why we take the risk of investing.
