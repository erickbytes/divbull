Title: Entering and Exiting a Position Slowly Over Time

Often investors make the mistake of the "all or nothing" fallacy. I consider this 
to be the error of thinking you need to go "all in" heavy all at once, and sell out 
for profit by exiting a position.

My investing reality does not function this way. I find I will often buy and sell stocks 
intermittently over time, lowering or buying more and raising my exposure based on recent events, 
earnings reports and price movements.

Sometimes it becomes clear that a company has negative headwinds, so I might lighten up. 
Otherwise, if a trend like AI presents itself as an opportunity, I tend to lean in to that trend.
 
Today, I bought more Spotify. It's the first time since I added more shares at $403 in Nov. 2024. 
I also trimmed some shares earlier this year, but wanted to invest more in this winning company.

I've now bought Spotify stock in a range of $75 to $685 per share. Up at this high level, I'm not adding heavily.
I do want to bring Spotify to an invested capital level on par with Meta and Google investments. 
In my view, this is a high conviction hold that has earned its spot among tech's elite companies.

I may regret adding Spotify at such a high valuation. The business looks strong, now over 700 million 
monthly active users. Sometimes, we should look to add to our winners. In my opinion, Spotify has proven 
it is a winner. Assuming the executive team is able to continue its stellar performance,
I believe the stock is going higher. However, such a high price implies risk should their impressive growth slow.

On Tesla, I've been lowering my cost basis by selling shares I bought at higher lots. I have 
"house money" riding in the stock. I added and reduced my position at various times. I sold 76% 
of my total Tesla stake over the past 3 years, locking in a tidy amount of profits. I want to hang 
on to my last 100 shares for a long time.

Companies like Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta have become a measuring bar for me.
Do I think this can achieve better returns than the "hyperscalers"? If not, I probably won't add or 
maybe might lighten up a position.Typically, I will only do this when I need to pay taxes or raise 
cash for living expenses.

In fact, the only stock I've never sold a share of is Microsoft. This is very rare, but it has been 
my highest conviction play in the past 5 years. It's worked out great, with some lucky timing to  
catch the AI trend. This is more exception than the norm. Typically, I will be leveling a stock 
position over time in line with where I see suitable levels of invested capital versus other stocks.
