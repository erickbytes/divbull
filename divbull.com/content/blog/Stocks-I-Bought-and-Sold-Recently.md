### Buys
These are stocks I bought this year, 2025. Most were bought in dollar cost average 
fashion as prices fluctuated throughout the year.

**MSFT**

It is often cited as a "tech ETF" in itself due to diversifed revenue streams, key OpenAI partnership,
and incredible executive team. Github, Github Copilot, Azure cloud computing growth, AI infrastructure play. 
Not to mention its gaming operations. I have committed more capital here than anywhere else over the past 5 years. 
I have other dividend stocks like Costco, Coca-Cola and Ford. This stock is worth mentioning as a "buy" 
in my book because of the dividend stream. Unfortunately, I didn't buy any more whole Microsoft shares YTD, 
which was a missed opportunity. However, I have bought in the past. I always reinvested my dividends so 
I am always buying fractional shares. I buy Microsoft 4 times a year, every year thanks to reinvesting 
my quarterly dividend. Halfway through 2025, I've reinvested $125 of dividends back into Microsoft stock.


**NVDA**

A top 3 high conviction hold if not #1. Picks and shovels for the AI revolution. 
Hyperscalers pay Nvidia for AI. Data center revenue is on fire, up 73% year over year according to their Q1 earnings report. 
I beefed up my long position, picking up shares from $95 to $147. I paid $12/share for 50 shares in 2021. 
That's what I'm still holding from my first buy after stock splits. Good enough for a 13x return. Staying long.

**ORCL**

One of my highest conviction holds outside of Microsoft and Nvidia. I got in last November 
and added more shares in January. They're the hyperscaler no one remembers until they need 
AI cloud computing capabilities delivered in a sensible and straightforward way. Enter Oracle. 
Add in that they're buying nuclear reactors, data centers and signing billion dollar deals,
with a burgeoning backlog order book and you have a wealth of possible catalysts coming in the future.
From their Q1 earnings call: "we will build and operate more cloud infrastructure data centers than all of our competitors combined".

**NTDOY**

After buying at various times since 2021, I added more Nintendo ADRs in anticipation of the runup to their 
Switch 2 release after seeing the signs of successful console launch. My intuition was rewarded, as the ADR 
price is up 49% year to date. I boosted my ADR share count by ~33% in March, April and June after the launch. 
I have high confidence in Nintendo to ride the Switch 2 console and continue rolling out new games like 
Donkey Kong Bananza to galvanize the fan base. It will continue to leverage its intellectual property. The new 
Florida "Super Nintendo World" theme park opened for business in May at Universal Studios. Plus Super Mario Bros 
and Zelda movie releases are coming. Nintendo seems to have many positive catalysts ahead. Nintendo is creating
new generations of fans beyond its past consoles like the Super Nintendo, N64, Gameboy, Nintendo DS, Wii and the 
original Switch. This is an impressive company, the more you learn about it. I'm enjoying having this international 
stock in my portfolio. Includes added bonuses like a stake in The Pokemon Company and the Seattle Mariners baseball 
team, plus a semi-annual dividend. I have been loving the ["Nintendo Today!" app](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-today-mobile/?srsltid=AfmBOor9ScrJgzMyLeOriEzFUitceiCOpHfL-K4HdLHW7O16YyVWRE45) to keep up with happenings. It makes you realize the depth and breadth of their IP. It also showcases how good they are at building hype with events like Switch 2 previews and "Nintendo Direct". 
For example, the [Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg&ab_channel=NintendoofAmerica) 
seemed to make a big splash to draw attention to the game before it released. These type of successful, high profile 
game releases will drive more console sales.


**RAYJ**

In addition to Nintendo, other Japanese equities are very intriguing to me. The [RAYJ ETF](https://funds.rayliant.com/rayj/) raises 
my international exposure via Japanese growth stocks like Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Hitachi, 
Sanrio, Asics, Toyota, Ryohein Keikaku, Disco Corp and many others. I like this as a diversification play
away from the US hyperscalers and S&P.

**RDDT**

Reddit is a guilty pleasure for me. I spend way too much time there. They seem to have a mine of fodder for
AI to train on in their forums. They reported that in Q1 of this year, their data licensing business grew 66% year over year.
They also recorded their first quarterly profit since their IPO. Additionally, their ads business is an opportunity for growth.
Often I find if I use an app or product nearly every day, it is a signal that it might be a good investment. 
But then again, I could have drawn the same conclusion about Stack Overflow 10 years ago and it would have 
turned out to be incorrect. In January, I bought some shares at $185. In April, I bought more at $87. I continued 
adding on the bounce since April. As it stands, I'm holding the position at breakeven. 

**DUOL**

Speaking of apps I use everyday. Duolingo seems to be growing their MAUs and Duolingo Max paid subscriptions at a good clip. Their app makes 
learning an addicting habit. The stock is highly valued, but I'm willing to make the bet based on the past 
few earnings calls. I'm on a 131 day Spanish streak. Using the product, I'm enjoying it. Their artistic execution 
makes learning more fun. Per their Q1 earnings report, Duolingo added a record number of DAUs, surpassing 10 
million paid subscribers. They are rapidly expanding their course offering with the help of AI. I bought the dip in March,
but regret that I didn't trim profits when stock sharply rose above $500 after its most recent earnings report. 
It's now hovering around $360. Maybe it's smart to keep the shares. I feel this could be a good stock long term, 
given what I have witnessed so far.

**FUBO**

I bought more Fubo TV since the merger deal with Disney was announced. It hasn't been great adding more since 
the initial pop off the deal news in early January. I believe that this will go higher once the deal with Disney closes. 
Fubo was making moves before they struck an agreement with Disney, so I added more to a winner. 
Hoping it pays off in the future, but so far 2025 has not been great outside of the first week of the year.
I like the stock as a play on streaming and live sports.

**SOUN**

Soundhound AI's voice technology is feeding American businesses' hunger to deploy agentic AI.
Companies like Oracle, Alibaba, Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft are spending aggressively to win 
on the infrastructure side of AI. Soundhound is a way to play the application layer.
Customers of their voice tech include Five Guys, White Castle and Casey's General Stores.

**EL**

I'm sized small into a rebound stock. Now that I'm married I have realized the opportunity in 
the women cosmetics and beauty industry. Estee Lauder is a familiar name that is bouncing as 
of late. I rolled the dice with a $500 starter position. I'm up 20%, $108.69. Going well so far!

**HOOD**

Similar to EL, I'm following a hot hand in the market. Robinhood is one of the fastest moving "momentum stocks". 
It's gone up a lot, but I decided to play a small position here also. So far, I'm up 14%, $79. Like Estee Lauder, 
if it ever has a pullback, I'd consider adding more. Or maybe I'll add on the way up. That's the way to do it 
for some of the best stocks.


**SWPPX**

Buying the best 500 US companies via an index fund. I added more S&P 500 index in April near the bottom
near peak panic in April.


### Sells

I sold part of my positions in stocks like RBLX, COIN and NET because they went up after being down for years. 
In others like SPOT, RACE and MELI I'm trying to jump on a train that has been humming along.
In some cases, I was doing more pruning than big sells. Often, I sold off my higher cost lots in pieces 
at different times as the shares continued rising this year. The share counts represent what was sold only 
since January 2025 to now. I had to decide which stocks to sell in order to pay an abnormally high tax bill this year.


**RBLX**

Happy to see this stock finally lift in price after years in the dumps. I wish I bought and held more, but feel good 
with the shares I've kept. I intend to hold on as Roblox seems to have improving fundamentals every day. In this Q1 
of this year, they had 8 million daily active users, with the average user spending 2.4 hours per day on Roblox.

Sold: 33 Shares

Remaining: 27 Shares


**NET**

The edge computing layer of the internet. Cybersecurity. I was overweight Cloudflare for a long time 
and am finally taking profits and trimmed my shares I bought from $125 to $200 before the drop.
It was one hell of a ride from buying in near $200 in 2021 to the bottom in 2022 where I bought 
as low as $39. In the end, I have a multi-bagger. The price has gone 5x those $39 shares to $199! Only 
Tesla, Nvidia, Spotify and Coinbase have achieved better returns for me. Cloudflare is going to win at 
AI by being an internet advocate and mediary between the hyperscalers and the web.

Sold: 66 Shares

Remaining: 40 Shares


**CRWD**

Crowdstrike is another cybersecurity champion in today's stock market. They handled last July's blunder 
with grace. It seems all is well for the leader in endpoint security. Long term, the stock looks great. 
Its valuation demands perfection, but thus far they've delivered the goods. One of the strongest Cybersecurity 
companies in the stock market.

Sold: 7 Shares

Remaining: 13 Shares


**COIN**
 
Cryptocurrency is here. Bitcoin can't be ignored. This company will be at the forefront of bringing
crypto to the people. The stock rebounded from its all-time low of $31, thanks to the US government's
anti-crypto policies that have since reversed in support for cryptocurrencies. I scooped shares
along the way, but this one was a super volatile ride that made it extremely frustrating at times. 
Like many of the stocks here, I could have made more. I decided to take small profits from 
unrealized gains and sell some higher cost trading share lots at their cost basis on the way up. 
Nonetheless, long conviction rewarded my portfolio with another multi-bagger.

Sold: 9 Shares

Remaining: 11 Shares


**SOXX**

Trimmed my semiconductors ETF investment after it rebounded huge since April, like many stocks.
This was a small amount of the position, approximately 4% of my stake. It was needed for extra money to pay taxes, 
like most of these sells. Still very bullish on semiconductors and their role in the AI trend. 
This ETF has all the big names like Nvidia, AMD, Taiwan Semiconductor, Intel, Kla Corp, ASML and more.

Sold: 2 Shares

Remaining: 45 Shares

**CROX**

I like the Crocs product and business concept. Footwear has a huge total addressable market.
I see their product everywhere I go. I think this is a possible "value stock". Buying here is a reasonable 
valuation for a successful footwear phenomenon. It is a business with strong management.
I like the stock. We'll see where it goes. I lightened the position because it has not moved much lately,
and think there are better opportunities. I still believe there is some bite left in this stock.

Sold: 9 Shares

Remaining: 45 Shares


**COST**

Costco stock has been good to me since I bought my first share in 2023. I took some profits from $949-$1034 per share. 
The business is so impressive to me. I'm a fan and a shareholder. Sometimes I get to visit by knowing someone who is 
a member, what a treat. The $1.50 hotdog is a shining beacon of corporate strategy at its finest. 
The Costco team is crushing it and people love the store. I'm going to be a shareholder, maybe forever.

Sold: 6 Shares

Remaining: 9 Shares

**BABA**

I felt a bit overweight in this Chinese stock. So far, I'm in the green with profits on the position.
This is the Chinese hyperscaler infrastructure play. It has a better case that it is undervalued compared to 
the US hyperscalers. I'm bullish on Baba and could see it being a $200 stock someday. Staying long my ADRs and
collecting my dividends.

Sold: 18 Shares

Remaining: 75 Shares

**META**

Sold a chunk of Meta shares to raise money. Bullish on their ads business and ability to use AI to improve its
effectiveness. Meta is flashing cash to build an AI superteam. Who knows how itwill shake out, but Meta will 
be there competing with AI. Lightened position because I needed extra cash. Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram: 
4 billion people use at least 1 of their apps a day according to their Q1 earnings call. I believe we will see 
Meta stock at $1000 per share someday.

Sold: 3 Shares

Remaining: 7 Shares

**GOOG**

I chose to make a slight trim of shares I bought at $180 before their earnings report. I regretted it because 
the sentiment has flipped somewhat bullish recently. This sell is more about leveling this to even with my 
Meta and Spotify investments. YouTube ad revenue is running up. Search revenue is still growing. 
Playing in the data center space. Cloud computing grew 28% year over year in the most recent quarter. 
Gemini has 450 million users, including me. Waymo is growing, solidifying Google's leadership in autonomous taxis.
All bullish indicators. Google is still winning. The trillion dollar question is what will happen to their
profit stream of search in the future, which will need to be defended against new AI competition.

Sold: 4 Shares

Remaining: 26 Shares

**AMZN**

Another hyperscaler. Investing in Anthropic. Has Zoox in the autonomous taxi space. Zoox began testing in Los Angeles, 
the sixth location for Amazon’s self-driving technology. The godfather of e-commerce with an ads business and streaming. 
Bezo's baby. C'mon it's Amazon! Yet another cloud computing competitor in AWS. Lots to like. 
I added 3 shares in April at $171. In July, I sold 3 shares that I bought in my taxable brokerage at $228. Essentially 
my share count remained the same, but my cost basis was reduced by approximately $150 with this maneuver.

Sold: 3 Shares

Remaining: 14 Shares

**RACE**

Ferrari makes one less car than the market demands to always ensure a full order book. They mentioned their order book is 
"covered" through 2026 on their Q1 earnings call. I like that it's an international, European equity. I already am heavily 
invested in several automakers and lightened up at all-time highs to raise funds.

Sold: 1 Share

Remaining: 3 Shares

**SPOT**

I decided to lock in some long term profits around $500. I sold 5 shares around $485 at the cost 
I bought them at in an attempt to trade short term. Should have held them all! I ended up buying back 2 shares recently.
Hyper bullish on this stock. They recently reported that in Q1, free cash flow was up 10x over the past 3 years.

Sold: 10 Shares

Remaining: 17 Shares


**MELI**

This payments company runs like water through South America. I was overweight at the beginning of the year, so I used
it as a source of funds for living expenses. I'm wishing I kept more MercadoLibre shares, but have conviction to keep what I have
and add on any big dips.

Sold: 5 Shares

Remaining: 2 Shares

**DIS**

Disney's theme parks are a cash machine. Its streaming service is now profitable. Its intellectual property is loved globally 
from Mickey and Minnie to the Pixar universe and beyond. In 2024, it had the top 2 theatrical releases with Deadpool and Wolverine
and Inside Out 2. Marvel is still a big draw. They are finalizing a deal with Fubo to solidify the live sports offering in addition to ESPN.
I had bought more heavily the past few years, and felt overweight here, so I've reduced my share count now that stock has bounced up above $120. 

Sold: 18 Shares

Remaining: 43 Shares

**O**

Realty Income is a REIT that won't blow you away with growth. The monthly dividend income is a fun twist on investing.
I lightened up on my taxable brokerage position, and bought some in my Roth IRA where the dividends will enjoy tax advantages.

Sold: 27 Shares

Remaining: 75 shares


**TM**

Have been holding Toyota ADRs for years. I trimmed my higher cost lots,
but will remain long. Since 2020, Toyota has sold more than 52 million cars at an average price of $32,000.
The quarterly dividend is a nice bonus also.

Sold: 10 Shares

Remaining: 20 Shares

**PINS**

Pinterest shares have always shown promise to me. After 4 years, it has yet to come to fruition. I'm still underwater on my shares.
I took out some of my invested capital at cost more or less for this reason. The promise is still there, with a company that is actively using
and developing new AI capabilities. Pinterest posted a record 570 million global monthly active users in Q1, up 10%.

Sold: 10 Shares

Remaining: 40 Shares


**AAPL**

I have been holding a small bag of Apple shares, because its cellular ecosystem is fine tuned to reap profits.
However, the obvious problem with the stock now is that they have no AI momentum. They're behind.
I am not holding much Apple individually, but have more exposure in my S&P 500 fund. I took 1 share off
because I don't like how the company operates with developers and its app store practices. Plus, they missed the boat on AI.

Sold: 1 Share

Remaining: 5 Shares


**XYZ**

I got fed up with Block after buying the top in 2021 and buying the dip since. I sold out at a loss. Complete exit. 
Not much good to say about Square, I mean Block, after holding for 4 years. Good riddance. After I sold out, 
it was added to the S&P 500, so I guess I will ride the upside in my S&P fund if it ever materializes.

Sold: 20 Shares

Remaining: 0 Shares

**ENPH**

My solar stocks have mostly gone down and decreased the value of my investments. I believe in solar, but the industry seems 
to settling out with winners and losers. I decided to close out my entire position in Enphase Energy. I couldn't justify 
staying invested with low conviction when so many better companies are out there. Earnings reports seemed to always disappoint.
Took a loss and closed out this solar bet.

Sold: 40 Shares

Remaining: 0 Shares

**FSLR**

Trimming on my solar allocation. Solar is facing some negative headwinds thanks to President Trump's big beautiful bill.
Staying long First Solar as my only solar investment.

Sold: 6 Shares

Remaining: 10 Shares

**TSLA**

I caught the wave of Tesla finding profitability from 2019 to 2021. I'm trimming my exposure by taking profits
after a wild ride the past 6 years. I'm keeping the rest as a long term hold. I will be monitoring 
the robotaxi expansion and optimus progress dilligently. Hopefully auto sales will pick back up to help
support its unconventional valuation. Tesla isn't just a car company. It will be so much more according to Elon.
Never bet against Elon.
 
Sold: 99 Shares

Remaining: 106 Shares
