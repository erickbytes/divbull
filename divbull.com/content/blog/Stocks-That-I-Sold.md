I am a "Buy and hold" investor, but not forever. More like buy, hold and make sure the business delivers value or sell. The question often comes up, "When do I sell?". This is unique to every investment and each investor's goals. For me, the baseline of the S&P 500 is a consideration. Do I think this stock can beat the returns of the S&P 500? If the answer is no, I probably will sell the stock.

I've needed to raise money from my stock portfolio this year. More often, I chose to sell some underperforming stocks at a loss or small profit versus trimming the winners. Each of these stocks was held for at least 1-3 years until I decided to close the position. Here are stocks I sold out of recently and why:

**Snowflake (SNOW)**

- sold for: -$1,155.92 loss (-17.56%)
- reason: excessive stock based compensation (41% of revenue), usage based model still needs to be proved, management sub-par + killed the stock price, not currently profitable, product is a glorified database?

**Etsy (ETSY)**

- sold for: -$1,594.53 loss (-37.55%)
- reason: earnings reports have been consistently underwhelming, competition from Shein/Temu, lack of relevance and growth slowing

**The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW)**

- sold for: +$176.36 gain (+14.65%)
- reason: lackluster earning reports, sentiment very low, new brokerage/Robin Hood competition, customer outages, lack of growth prospects

**DigitalOcean (DOCN)**

- sold for: -$324.36 loss (-31.56%)
- reason: not profitable, competitor with AWS, bought Amazon AMZN instead

**Canopy Growth Corporation (CGC)**

**Coursera (COUR)**

- reason: not profitable, prefer better opportunities to invest

**Datadog (DDOG)**

- sold for: $469.79 gain (+21.21%)
- reason: cutting back tech exposure, huge bills for most customers could be a negative

**UIPath (PATH)**

- sold for: -$312.96 loss (-51.44%)
- reason: recent CEO shakeup, product potential existential threat by AI, not profitable

**Roku (ROKU)**

- sold for: -$631.42 loss (-36.62%)
- reason: dependent on TV manaufacturers, TV Operating System needs distribution. Lack of a moat?

**Yeti (YETI)**

- reason: prefer other industries than outdoor coolers and drinkware

**Okta (OKTA)**

- sold for: -$86.19 loss (-3.15%)
- reason: decided to consolidate tech holdings, rotated position into Crowdstrike (CRWD)

**Grab (GRAB)**

- sold for: +$36.80 gain (+7.32%)
- reason: not profitable, don't like the industry economics (rideshare and delivery)

**Dutch Bros (BROS)**

- sold for: +$6.14 gain (+2.11%)
- reason: recent food and beverage industry headwinds, will take years to build out new locations

**Portillos (PTLO)**

- sold for: -$440.36 loss (-55.47%)
- reason: recent food and beverage industry headwinds, will take years to build out new locations

**Sunrun (RUN)**

- sold for: -$1,242.67 (-54.58%)	
- reason: consolidating solar industry positions and prefer Enphase Energy or First Solar

**Sofi Technologies (SOFI)**

- sold for: -$362.07 (-34.55%)
- reason: price trades erratically, prefer to invest in other industries, lack of catalysts to move stock

**Conclusion**

Time will tell where these companies go. Each investment you choose has an opportunity cost. If you invest in one stock, you can't invest in another. I sold these stocks because I needed the money, but also because I felt that I should consolidate my portfolio into fewer positions. I hope by selling off the worst performers, I will hold onto the stocks that give great returns in the future.
