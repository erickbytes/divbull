Don't put all your eggs in one basket. We can avoid this scenario by taking positions that act as a hedge against one another. 
Here are two examples of hedge pair trades that I've taken in my portfolio:

1) Nvidia vs. Emerging Semiconductors

Right now the most common argument against buying Nvidia stock is that they won't be able to maintain their 95% market share only for so long. 

I'm holding an Nvidia long position, but realized when I buy other semiconductors, I'm hedging against their dominany position eroding over time.

Here are the top 10 holdings of SOXX:

    NVDA NVIDIA Corporation (9.74%)
    AVGO Broadcom Inc. (7.95%)
    QCOM QUALCOMM Incorporated (7.41%)
    AMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (6.18%)
    MU Micron Technology, Inc. (5.18%)
    ADI Analog Devices, Inc. (4.54%)
    TXN Texas Instruments Incorporated (4.38%)
    MCHP Microchip Technology Incorporated (4.33%)
    TSM Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (4.17%)
    KLAC Kla Corp (4.16%)

Other notable holdings include Intel, Marvell, Lam Research and a basket of 30+ semiconductor related companies. If you're bullish on semiconductors, why not play the field? You're still buying Nvidia, but spreading your bet amongst a bunch of promising companies. If you believe a rising tide lifts all boats and there will be many winners in our AI future... why not own some Nvidia and something like the SOXX ETF?

2) Tesla + EVs + China Automakers (Future Automobiles) Vs. Toyota + Ford (Legacy Automobiles)

Tesla boomed in the early 2020s by riding the EV wave and a low interest rate environment to payday. However, now the reality of 2024 is setting in for the electric vehicle market. Our EV future is somewhat postponed at the moment, or maybe it will take longer than we thought. 

Hybrid vehicles have emerged as the most sought after type of vehicle after Tesla rode the EV boom into 2021. Toyota is notably the biggest winner in the resurgence of hybrids and the purest play to fade our electric vehicle future. Toyota has been vocal in their opposition against the feasibility of electric vehicles. Ford is also losing money on its electric vehicle program but has remained committed to a profitable electric vehicle in the future, so they are less of a direct play against Tesla. 

Holding both Tesla and legacy auto is a way to play both sides of the transition to electric vehicles. If consumer tastes move towards hybrids in the short term, Tesla will have a tougher environemnt to sell cars and Toyota will reap rewards from selling more hybrids. If electric vehicles gain more traction, the most likely outcome in the long run, fade legacy auto. Play both sides of the trade by holding both.

Conclusion

It's important to identify when an industry has "many winners" versus possibly only a few elite companies that emerge in the long run. It's possible to have the right industry, but not the right execution by the company you own. We can mitigate risk by making trades that hedge each other. This might limit gains on a higher conviction play, but it also caps your losses if the play doesn't pan out.
