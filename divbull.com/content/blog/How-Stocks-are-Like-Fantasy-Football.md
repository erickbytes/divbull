As both an investor and fantasy football participant for many years, I often remark how similar they are.
This is a post I've been kicking around in my head for a while and finally decided to write.

Fantasy football begins each football season by players paying "dues" into a league pot. This is paid out 
to the top 3 places in my 10 team league. The action begins each year with a draft of players. There are many 
high profile players like Christian McCaffery, Jonathan Taylor and Jamarr Chase that go in the early rounds due 
to their projected production over the course of the season. These players are similar to blue chip stocks like Nvidia, 
Apple and Microsoft. When drafting a player, it's easy to infer from last season's performance that they are going to have another 
banner year. Often marquee running backs can wear down as they get older, causing injuries that affect performance. If 
you drafted Christian McCaffery in 2024, the #1 overall consensus pick, you dealt with injuries all year and had a tougher 
season than you expected. As is often said in stocks, past performance does not guarantee future returns. The biggest winners 
of the past may follow with slow decline in the later stages of a company's lifecycle.

In fantasy football, there is a free agent pool of players that are not currently "owned" by any teams.
They can be added to your team by swapping out another player on your roster. Similarly, there are a lot of 
stocks out there that can be added to your portfolio, but only a small number will give coveted market beating returns. 
The best gains are made from finding overlooked players that have more value than the consensus opinion, yielding 
more points than they're projected. This is true of stocks as well. Finding undervalued companies is the best way 
to make exceptional returns.

Constructing a roster of players is similar to building an investment portfolio. You don't want to be too
dependent on the production of 1 or 2 players. Diversification across your wide receivers, running backs 
and tight ends is important. You also need depth because your players can get injured. That's when it's 
important to have a servicable backup at each position. Otherwise, you'll be left picking from the scraps 
in the free agent pool. But sometimes we can find a diamond in the rough. A player who gives outsized production 
against their projections. This season, one of those players for me was tight end Jake Ferguson. I had drafted 
George Kittle, a highly touted playmaker. He injured his hamstring in Week 1. I picked up Jake Ferguson from 
the free agent pool and it has been the pickup of the season so far. These types of moves are similar to finding 
a small cap stock with great fundamentals and outlook. This is how you can achieve outsized returns and beat the market.

When selecting a player in fantasy football, it's important to consider the upcoming matchups on the team's schedule. 
Additionally the weather can play a factor, especially for quarterbacks, wide receivers and kickers. These factors 
are like the macroeconomic environment and competitive pressures to consider when selecting a stock. We need to 
research and think hard about how these forces might impact the company we own. We might pick a great company, 
but external forces limit their ability to execute. When a player is not executing, we need to constantly evaluate 
why that is not happening. Should we give them more weeks to see if their production increases? Or should we switch 
to a player that is already producing? This is true for stocks also. If a stock is not producing returns, how long 
should you wait? This is one of the hardest decisions to make in investing. There's nothing more frustrating than 
cutting a player for your squad, only for them to surge in points after you part ways. Sometimes stocks are like this also. 
They'll do nothing for years, only to moon after you cut it. Often we should "water our flowers and cut the weeds",
to paraphrase famed investor Peter Lynch. This means the stocks we should buy are usually the ones that have already performed well,
rather than going fishing for a comeback or turnaround story. The best opportunities are usually already good performers,
but not always!

In both stocks and fantasy football, it's important to build up a watchlist of stocks to keep an eye on. Players can 
become more valuable or suffer production from other players getting injured. Your watchlist is where you hope to see 
opportunities when other teams cut a player who has not done much recently, or a young player can gain traction and become 
a part of your team. When a stock on your watchlist suffers a large drawdown, you might consider getting in at a discount.

In fantasy football, there are "experts" who put out rankings of players, sit or start lists and top waiver wire pickups each week.
In stocks, the equivalent are financial analysts and firms who assign ratings and price targets to the stocks they cover.

Additionally, the geopolitical developments and government policies sometimes impact a company's performance. Similarly, 
referees may intervene or assist a player's success. Stocks do not exist in a vacuum. Players must abide by the rules and 
hope not to become a victim of human error.However, bad calls and bad luck are inevitable in the game of football and investing.

I hope you enjoyed this brain dump of the parallels between fantasy football and investing. Both require research and strategy.
Both require monitoring the data, earnings reports, stats and production output. Both can make you money. One is a hobby 
with a possible payout of a few hundred dollars for me and the other can open a new world of financial freedom. That's the 
biggest difference between them!
